1,1,"Desire for growth in loveliest of beings,
To keep beauty's bloom from meeting end,
As aging gives way, new life life extends,
The legacy of loveliness to commend.
Yet you, confined to your own bright gaze,
Nourish your light's fire with self-same fuel,
Creating hunger in a land of bounty's maze,
An enemy unto your own self, far too cruel.
You, now the earth's resplendent decor,
And harbinger of spring in all its splendor,
In your own bud, treasure your delight,
A miserly act, wasting wonders center.
Have mercy on the world, or this insatiate wight,
Shall consume what's owed, by death and thee.

"
1,2,"In the fairest of beings, we crave increase,
Lest beauty's flower ever fade away,
As time takes elder lives, new ones release,
The memory of beauty's splendor to convey.
But you, enamored of your bright own eyes,
Feed your light's blaze with self-made sustenance,
Causing famine amidst the land's surplus supplies,
An adversary unto your own self, too harsh in recompense.
You, now the world's adorning jewel,
And lone herald of the gaudy spring,
In your own bud, your pleasure you conceal,
A niggardly act, wasting treasures like a fool.
Show pity to the world, or this gluttonous being,
Shall eat the world's share, by doom and your own doing.

"
1,3,"For fairest beings, we yearn for more to grace,
Lest beauty's rose ever lose its sheen,
As age claims elders, room for new ones to take place,
The memory of beauty's splendor to maintain.
Yet you, enamored of your bright own sphere,
Nourish your light's fire with self-same fuel,
Breeding famine amidst the land's rich bounty, my dear,
An enemy to your own self, too harsh and cruel.
You, now the world's ornament of delight,
And sole herald of the gaudy springtime scene,
In your own bud, treasure your delight,
A miserly deed, wasting riches like a queen.
Take pity on the world, or this insatiable knight,
Shall consume the world's portion, by fate and your hand."
2,1,"As forty winters carve their icy lines on your brow
And plow deep furrows in your field of charm,
The livery of your youth, so admired, will bow
To a tattered weed, of meager worth, a harm.
If asked of your beauty's fate, its grand demise,
To answer, ""In mine own eyes it resides,""
Would bring forth a shame, a regret, and waste,
A thriftless praise for your once lustrous days.

Oh, how much more fitting if you could proclaim,
""This offspring of mine, this wondrous child,
Bears the torch of my beauty, unashamed,
Preserving my allure, a progeny wild.""

Thus, reborn and anew, you'd face winter's cold,
Warmth in your blood, a spirit yet bold.

"
2,2,"When winter's hand has etched its stories on your brow
And plowed its chilling furrows in your face,
The bloom of youth, so proudly worn, will bow
To a fading glory, a memory of grace.
If asked of your beauty's remnants, lost and gone,
To say within thine own heart it remains,
Would birth a shame, a sorrow, a mournful sigh,
A hollow praise for your past days' reign.

How much more glorious if you could declare,
""This precious child of mine, this gift from above,
Carries my legacy, my flame to bear,
An everlasting beauty, a ceaseless love.""

Reborn through your offspring, your spirit takes flight,
Basking in youth, while greeting the night.

"
2,3,"When winter's snowflakes, in their multitude, assail
And carve their paths on your visage, so fair,
The bloom of your youth, once a glorious tale,
Shall fade to a shadow, a whisper, a mere.
If asked where your beauty has taken leave,
To answer, ""In mine own soul it stays,""
Would bring forth a grief, a regret, a sigh,
A praise in vain for your past days' plays.

Oh, how much more radiant if you could confess,
""This heir of mine, this paragon of grace,
Shall bear my visage, my loveliness,
An ever-renewing beauty, a warm embrace.""

Thus, reborn and refreshed, you'll face winter's might,
With warmth in your heart, and a steady light."
3,1,"Gaze upon your reflection, observe the visage
Now is the moment to create anew,
Lest you deceive the world, a transgression,
Avoided by the blessings you bestow.
Who else possesses such beauty untouched,
Rejecting nurture from a partner's hand?
Or who, so enamored with self, allows
Their lineage to cease on this mortal land?
You are the mirror of your mother's youth,
Her vibrant spring returns through you to life,
Thus, through the glass of age, you'll glimpse the truth,
Defying wrinkles, savoring golden strife.
  But if no echo of your days remains,
  Embrace solitude, and let oblivion reign.

"
3,2,"Contemplate your image, the face that stares,
A chance to craft an imprint for an heir,
If not rejuvenated, time impairs,
And orphaned mothers weep for loss and care.
Who else could boast such peerless beauty,
Refusing cultivation from a mate?
Or who, so captivated by their fate,
Would choose a grave for love of self-purity?
You bear your mother's likeness, her delight,
Her youthful spring reborn through you once more,
Through the prism of your years, you'll witness light,
Despite the lines, your gilded age will soar.
  Yet, if no trace of you remains in minds,
  Choose solitude, and let your image fade.

"
3,3,"Study the visage in the looking glass,
Now seize the instant to rejuvenate,
Lest you deceive the world, and it will pass,
Unmindful of the debt you failed to create.
Who else could claim such beauty unmarred,
Rejecting union with a lover's grace?
Or who, so captivated by their face,
Would halt their line, and leave no trace?
You are your mother's mirror, her delight,
Her youthful bloom reborn through you anew,
Through the lens of age, you'll glimpse the sight,
Defying wrinkles, your golden age imbue.
  But if no memory of you survives,
  Opt for solitude, and let your image die."
4,1,"Frugal allure, why do you hoard
Your inherited grace, kept to yourself?
Nature's endowment is not to be stored,
But lent freely, multiplying wealth.
So, why withhold the riches you possess,
Denying others their own fair share?
Your miserly ways only bring distress,
And leave no legacy but despair.
In solitude, you squander life away,
Cheating yourself, your true worth unseen.
What account can you give, on judgment day,
For the beauty you've kept locked within?
That unused treasure, buried with you,
Could have brought life, had you set it free.

"
4,2,"Prodigal loveliness, why lavish
Your gifts on superficial display?
Nature's loan demands that we be gracious,
Not squanderers who throw wealth away.
You, who have been given much, give little,
Holding fast to beauty's fleeting boon.
Yet, in your grasp, it shrivels, brittle,
And fades, unshared, beneath the moon.
Alone, you hoard your radiant allure,
Denying others the chance to share.
When nature calls, what balance will you cure?
Your ledger shows a wealth beyond compare.
But, unused beauty, hoarded and stilled,
Lies buried, its potential unfulfilled.

"
4,3,"Excessive charm, why do you squander
The gifts bestowed by nature's generous hand?
She gives not to those who only plunder,
But to those who share, and understand.
You, who have been given so much, give scant,
In solitude, your beauty unspent.
Yet, in your isolation, you can't
See how your riches could have been lent.
When nature summons, what account will you show?
Your unused beauty, buried with you,
Could have brought life, had you chosen to sow.
Instead, it lies fallow, its promise untrue.
So, excessive charm, learn to disseminate,
The beauty you keep is your own traitor."
5,1,"The gentle hours that shape such fair regard,
In time become tyrants, overshadowing
The grace they once held, now cruel and hard,
Unfairly reigning, yet excellent in showing.
For time unceasing propels seasons along,
From summer's bloom to winter's stark display,
Where once-green branches sing a mournful song,
And beauty fades beneath the cold array.
Were not the essence of summer's sweetness saved,
A captive jewel in glass, clear and bright,
Beauty's allure with beauty would be graved,
Leaving naught but darkness and forgotten plight.
  Yet flowers distilled, though met with winter's might,
  Lose but their form; their essence holds delight.

"
5,2,"The gentle hours that weave a lovely view,
In time become oppressors, dimming light,
Their grace obscured, their charm turned into
Unfair dominion, yet shining bright.
For time unyielding drives the seasons on,
From summer's splendor into winter's night,
Where once-verdant branches hum a mournful tone,
And beauty wanes beneath the icy blight.
Were not the soul of summer's brilliance kept,
A captive treasure in a crystal case,
Beauty's delight with beauty would be swept,
Leaving naught but shadows in its place.
  Yet flowers distilled, though met with frost's embrace,
  Lose but their guise; their essence still has grace.

"
5,3,"The tender hours that fashion beauty's face,
In time become oppressors, stealing sight,
Their charm concealed, their grace turned into
Unfair usurpers, yet retaining light.
For time unending leads the seasons on,
From summer's zenith to the winter's blight,
Where once-lush branches whisper a sad song,
And beauty fades beneath the snowy white.
Were not the quintessence of summer's charm saved,
A captive jewel in a glass so clear,
Beauty's allure with beauty would be waived,
Leaving naught but echoes of what was here.
  Yet flowers distilled, though met with winter's power,
  Lose but their guise; their essence still has flower."
6,1,"Restrain the winter's harsh, tattered grasp
From marring on thy summer's bloom before
It is condensed and treasured in a flask,
Or hidden in a place where beauty's lore
Resides in safety. Lend not to the spendthrift use
That brings no interest but a borrowed pain;
Instead, invest in thyself, increase
Thy virtues, and reap joy's harvest, gain
A bounty of happiness tenfold, outweigh
The weight of fleeting life. For if ten selves
Could rise again, reborn and amplified,
What power would death have, should it come to slay?
  Refrain from selfishness, embrace the role
  Of giver, and bequeath a noble soul.

"
6,2,"Withhold the winter's cruel, jagged claw
From marking on thy summer's splendid face,
Before its essence is distilled, endowed
Within a phial or some sacred space.
A loan that brings delight to those who lend
Is not usurious, but a blessed art;
To cultivate a second self, transcend
The boundaries of the heart, and impart
A greater self, ten times more blissful still,
Would be a gain worth more than life's own cost.
For if ten selves, reborn and multiplied,
Could stand where one had fallen, what could death claim?
  Resist the urge to hoard; instead, fulfill
  The nobler purpose, and ignite a flame.

"
6,3,"Deny the winter's rough and tattered hand
From marring on thy summer's bright array,
Before its nectar is preserved, grand
In some receptacle or hallowed bay.
That use is not unrighteous which imparts
A joy to those who lend, and borrow peace;
To grow another self within one's heart,
A soul that knows a tenfold ecstasy,
Would be a boon worth more than life's own worth.
For if ten selves, refigured and refined,
Could rise again, reborn and amplified,
What power would death have, should it come to call?
  Refrain from selfishness; instead, impart
  A legacy of love, and thine own soul shall grow."
7,1,"As dawn breaks in the east, graced by radiant light,
All creatures rise to greet the day's new sight,
Paying homage to the sun's ascent,
Awakening as it spills its gentle light.
Majestic in its middle age, it climbs,
Strength and vigor etched in every beam,
Yet, even as mortal age it skims,
We find ourselves still caught in its gleam.
But when this star, so bright, begins to wane,
Our gaze drifts off, no longer held,
To seek instead the rain or stars' refrain,
In things that shine when daylight has been quelled.
So you, like the sun, must shine your brightest hour,
Else unseen, you'll fade and lose your power.

"
7,2,"Behold, the orient's gentle, kindly light,
As dawn awakes and greets the morning bright,
Each eye that sees does homage to its face,
In awe of its celestial, warming grace.
With strength and power, it climbs the sky so high,
A picture of youth in its middle age, so spry,
And still, we mortals marvel at its might,
Adoring its golden, radiant light.
Yet, as it tires, its weary course it bends,
No longer able to keep up its ends,
Our eyes, once loyal, now to other things wend,
Leaving the sun to its nighttime trends.
Thus, like the sun, you too must shine your best,
Or else, when gone, you' ild be but a jest.

"
7,3,"In the orient, as the sun begins to rise,
Its gentle, gracious light greets eager eyes,
All creatures rise to pay their morning rites,
Basking in the sun's resplendent light.
With strength and vigor, it ascends the sky,
A portrait of youth in its middle age, nigh,
And still, we mortals gaze in pure delight,
Enchanted by its golden, shining light.
But when it starts to sag, its journey done,
Our eyes, once faithful, seek new horizons,
Abandoning the sun, now waxing wane,
For stars and moon, their gentle, softer glows.
Like the sun, you too must shine your brightest hour,
Or else, unseen, you'll fade and lose your power."
8,1,"To what do you lend your ear, O music, with sorrow?
Sweetness with sweetness does not wage war, delight dwells in delight.
Why do you cherish that which you do not welcome openly,
Or welcome with pleasure, your vexation's delight?

If the true harmony of well-matched notes,
By combined bonds, offends your hearing,
They but gently reproach you, confusing
The parts that you ought to carry, in singularity.

See how one string, a sweet spouse to another,
Each by the other is struck in mutual rhythm,
Resembling a father, a child, and a joyful mother
Who, all in one, one harmonious note do sing;

Whose unspoken song, being many, yet one,
Sings thus to thee: ""In solitude, thou shalt be none.""

"
8,2,"Pray tell, why do you listen to music with a heavy heart?
Sweetness finds joy in sweetness, mirth takes pleasure in mirth.
Why do you cling to what brings you no cheer,
Or brings you joy mingled with pain and fear?

If the true concord of finely tuned strains,
In harmonious union, displeases your ear,
They but softly scold you, confusing
The parts that you should unite, in unity keeping.

Gaze upon how one string, a loving partner to another,
Each by the other is stirred in mutual dance,
Resembling a sire who with his offspring does consort,
And a mother, all in one, one melodious note do sing;

Whose unvoiced song, many and one,
Sings thus to thee: ""In isolation, thou shalt be undone.""

"
8,3,"Hearken, why do you listen to music with a mournful air?
Sweetness finds delight in sweetness, rapture in rapture.
Why do you embrace what brings you no gladness,
Or brings you joy tainted with sadness?

If the true harmony of well-matched tones,
By combined grace, displeases your hearing,
They but gently reprove you, confounding
The parts that you should gather, in harmony keeping.

Observe how one string, a faithful companion to another,
Each by the other is struck in mutual harmony,
Resembling a father who with his kinship does accord,
And a mother, all in one, one symphonic note do sing;

Whose unspoken song, many and one,
Sings thus to thee: ""In solitude, thou shalt be undone."""
9,1,"For dread of dampening a window stained with grief,
Do you then burn, alone, in solitary plight?
Oh, should you pass, childless, from this earth's relief,
The world shall wail as a widowed spirit, bereft of light.
The world will weep for thee, its lonely, barren mate,
Lamenting that no trace of thee remains,
While every private widow, in her heart, creates
A shrine to her beloved, by memory's chains.
Consider then the profligate who lavishly spends
His bounty on the world, which ever craves his grace;
But beauty's treasure, if not lent or sends
Its gifts unto the world, will dwindle and efface.
No love for others dwells within that heart,
Which on itself such grievous wounds doth impart.

"
9,2,"Lest a widow's tear should dare to stain the ground,
Do you, in solitude, let your essence fade?
Oh, if you leave no heirs, no progeny to be found,
The world will mourn you like a widow left in shade.
The world will wail and gnash its teeth in despair,
Lamenting the void left by your form unseen,
While every private widow, in her quiet lair,
Can treasure her beloved, kept evergreen.
Ponder the profligate who, in his reckless spending,
Wastes his wealth upon the world, which never tires,
But beauty's bounty, if not sharing, lending,
Will vanish, leaving naught but ashen embers and ashes.
No love for others dwells within that soul,
Which on itself such cruel wounds doth take.

"
9,3,"To keep a widow's tear from ever wetting earth,
Do you, in solitude, consume your vital fire?
Oh, if you leave no offspring, no heir to claim your birth,
The world will weep for you, a widowed sire.
The world will wail and grieve, its heart laid bare,
Lamenting the loss of your unseen form,
While every private widow, in her lonely lair,
Can treasure her beloved, her heart's own norm.
Consider the profligate who, in his wild abandon,
Scatters riches on the world, which ever hungers,
But beauty's treasure, if not expanded, lent, or planned,
Will dwindle, leaving naught but embers and ashes clung.
No love for others dwells within that breast,
Which on itself such grievous wounds doth infest."
10,1,"Cease this denial of love you claim to shun,
In selfishness, your own heart you impoverish.
Concede, if you must, that many have won
Your heart, but few have received your favor.
For such loathing holds you captive and blind,
Plotting against your own existence.
Why destroy what you should strive to redefine,
A sanctuary worthy of preservance?
Oh, alter your perspective, let me see
A kinder, warmer, more inviting soul.
Let love reside where once there was hostility,
Transform into the person you control.
   Create a second self, for love of me,
   That beauty's flame may ever burn in thee.

"
10,2,"Desist from hiding love, which you disown,
In carelessness, your own heart you abandon.
Admit, if you are able, that you've grown
Affections for many, yet give none your hand.
For rage has conquered you, and now you plot
To bring ruin to the shelter you call home.
Instead, restore it, let your love be sought,
And find your heart's true place to roam.
Oh, change your mind, and I may change my plea,
Shall animosity be cherished more than love?
Let grace and kindness be your decree,
Or at least befriend the one you're above.
   Fashion for yourself a new identity,
   That beauty's legacy may thrive in thee.

"
10,3,"Relent, and admit that love you do withhold,
In recklessness, your own heart you endanger.
Confess, if you're willing, that many have enrolled
Their hearts in your affection, yet you remain estranged.
For fury has consumed you, and now you stand
To raze the refuge that you should revere.
Rather, rebuild it, let your love expand,
And let affection guide you near and clear.
Oh, transform your thoughts, and I may transform mine,
Shall wrath be honored over tender affection?
Let graciousness and warmth be your design,
Or at least extend kindness to your own creation.
   Forge a new self, for love of me,
   That beauty's memory may ever be."
11,1,"As swiftly as you fade, so swiftly bloom,
In one of yours, from what you left in gloom;
And that fresh life you youngly lay in tomb,
You may reclaim as yours upon life's cusp.
Herein lies wisdom, beauty, and rebirth,
Without this, decline and chill decay;
If everyone embraced such sacred mirth,
Age's cycle would not steal youth away.
Let those who lack the gifts of progeny,
Harsh, featureless, and raw, in scarcity,
Look to those she best endowed, set free,
Bountiful gifts to treasure lovingly.
  She carved you for her mark, her legacy,
  To multiply, not let that copy flee.

"
11,2,"As quickly as you wane, you shall expand,
In one of theirs, from what you left so grand;
And that fresh spirit you kindly lend,
You may reclaim as yours, by fate's command.
Herein lies wisdom, beauty, and respite,
Without this, age and cold decay will reign;
If everyone could grasp this insight,
Years would not steal the joy of youth in vain.
Let those who bear no fruit, in drought,
Harsh, featureless, and hollow, fade without,
Look to those she blessed, let them find out,
Bounteous gifts to cherish, to bear without.
  She carved you for her sign, her truth,
  To propagate, not let that copy soothe.

"
11,3,"As rapidly as you decline, you'll rise,
In one of theirs, from what you left behind;
And that fresh essence you so kindly prize,
You may reclaim as yours, by time's design.
Herein lies wisdom, beauty, and rebirth,
Without this, age and chill decay will stay;
If everyone could find this worth,
Years would not steal the bloom of youth away.
Let those who bear no offspring, in dearth,
Harsh, featureless, and stark, in barren earth,
Look to those she favored, find mirth,
Bounteous gifts to treasure, to give birth.
  She carved you for her mold, her art,
  To multiply, not let that copy depart."
12,1,"As I regard the clock that marks the hours
And watch the vibrant day succumb to night,
When violets fade and silver streaks adorn
The raven locks, once dark and full of might;
Observe trees, once lush, now stripped of verdant leaves,
Which once provided shelter for the flock,
And fields of green, now bound in sheaves,
Carried away on carts by Time's relentless clock;
I ponder then, if your own beauty too,
Like fleeting moments, will one day depart,
For all things lovely, in the end, are doomed,
To wither and decay, as other's hearts;
  No force can halt the march of Time's decree,
  But life, to face his scythe, and continue heedlessly.

"
12,2,"Considering the clock that tracks the fleeting hours,
Witnessing the radiant day swallowed by night,
Noticing violets wilt and dark hair turns to gray,
Time's cruel hand stealing the light;
See once-mighty trees, now lifeless and bare,
Their verdant canopy replaced by air,
And summer's green, now harvested and stored,
Brought forth by Time's unyielding, merciless roar;
Then, of your beauty, I begin to doubt,
Knowing it, too, must yield to Time's pursuit,
For beauty fades, as all things surely do,
Replaced by shadows, whispering mute;
  Only life persists, defying Time's cruel scythe,
  Pressing on through darkness, carrying the flame of life.

"
12,3,"Contemplating the clock that gauges time's swift course,
Observing the vivid day subdued by blackest night,
Finding violets faded, once-dark tresses now a silvery force,
Trees, once teeming, now barren, stripped of might;
Summer's green, now bound in sheaves,
Harvested by Time's unwavering, remorseless hand,
And fields once lush, now shorn and bereaved,
Borne away on carts from this fertile land;
Then, of your beauty, I begin to despair,
Knowing it, too, must wane, as fleeting as a prayer,
For beauty fades, as all things surely do,
Replaced by echoes, floating in the air;
  Yet life remains, confronting Time's unyielding scythe,
  Pressing on through shadows, bearing the torch of life."
13,1,"Oh, if you could only be truly you! Yet, my love,
Your essence is fleeting as your breath in air;
Prepare for the end, relinquish your self-love,
And let another claim your beauty's share.
Thus, your ephemeral grace may find new life,
A continuance in your child's tender form,
Reviving you from the brink of strife,
In the cradle of a new, blossoming storm.
Who would let such a radiant dwelling fall,
A sanctuary of love and grace,
Unless they were blind to beauty's call,
Or lacked the will to preserve its place?
  My love, you had a father; let your son proclaim,
  A testament to love that endures through name.

"
13,2,"Oh, that you were yourself, unchanged, unyielding,
But love, your form is but a transient guest;
Prepare for the departure, cease your selfish dwelling,
And pass your radiance on to the next.
So shall the beauty you possess extend,
Unfettered by the grasp of mortal time,
Reborn and mended, a new tale to lend,
Through the legacy of your offspring's prime.
Who would let a treasure such as this decay,
A citadel of warmth and light,
If not for those who've lost their way,
Denying the beacon of the day and night?
  My love, you had a father; let your son carry,
  The flame of memory, undiminished and hearty.

"
13,3,"Oh, that you were your true self, steadfast and bright,
But love, your essence is but a fleeting dream;
Prepare for the departure, take your leave in the night,
And let your visage in another gleam.
Thus, the beauty you embody may survive,
In the tender form of your scion's face,
Reviving your spirit, a tale to strive,
Through the legacy of your lineage's grace.
Who would let such a resplendent dwelling fade,
A fortress of love and delight,
Unless they were blind to beauty's trade,
Or lacked the will to preserve the sight?
  My love, you had a father; let your son become,
  The guardian of memory, strong and glowing from."
14,1,"I draw not wisdom from the celestial sphere,
Yet in mine eyes a cosmos do I bear--
Not to foretell of fortune's fleeting cheer,
Of famines, plagues, or seasons in disrepair.
No, I cannot number clouds and storms,
Nor predict the fates of monarchs bold,
In heaven's scriptures, secrets find their forms,
Of thee, dear heart, my sagacity unfolds.
In thine own gaze, my wisdom lies so deep,
A chart of truth and beauty's wondrous dance;
If thou wouldst but surrender, gently seep
Into thine own soul, and seize thy chance.
  Or else this prophecy shall come to pass:
  A tragic end awaits thy truth and grace.

"
14,2,"My lore is not from heaven's distant light,
Yet, in your orbs, a universe I see;
Not to forecast storms or weal of night,
Nor whisper fortunes to thee and me.
No skill have I to mark the gales' swift track,
Nor scan in stars the sovereign's fickle fate;
In heaven's book, such secrets lie in pack,
Of you, I learn the truth and beauty's trait.
In your sweet gaze, my knowledge does abide,
A tale of constellations, love, and art;
If you would but embrace, step inside,
Yourself, and let your spirit take its part.
  Or thus I predict, with heavy heart:
  Your doom is truth and beauty's to depart.

"
14,3,"My wisdom does not spring from lofty skies,
Yet, in your eyes, a boundless sea I find;
Not to foretell the tempests and sunrise,
Nor prophesy the sovereign's destiny entwined.
No power have I to trace the winds' wild swerve,
Nor read in stars the turns of royal lot;
In heaven's scroll, such mysteries preserve,
Of you, I learn the truth and beauty's knot.
In your own orbs, my learning does reside,
A testament of stars, in passion drowned;
If you would but embrace, step inside,
Yourself, and let your essence be renowned.
  Or else, my fearful prophecy will sound:
  Your end is truth and beauty's burial ground."
15,1,"In pondering all that flourishes and thrives,
I see perfection's fleeting, transient phase;
The vast world's stage, where stars in chorus dive,
In silent language whispering their ways.
As humans bloom, like plants, they rise and fall,
Their vibrant youth by selfsame sky inspired,
Yet wilt beneath its gaze, ambitions stall,
And beauty fades, forgotten and tired.
This thought of mutability stirs deep,
A battlefield where Time and Decay contend,
To rob you of your youth, and leave you weep,
Your vibrant day to dusk and darkness descended.
   And so, in love's defiant, warring strife,
   I'll graft new life, as Time takes from your life.

"
15,2,"Considering growth, I find a truth concealed,
A moment's grace in all that blooms and fades;
This grand stage shows a cosmic play unsealed,
Where suns and moons on human lives parade.
Like plants, we rise and fall in life's great dance,
In youth exulting, in decay we mourn,
As fleeting beauty leaves its wistful glance,
And memories of vibrant days are torn.
This thought ignites a war within my soul,
A fight to keep the grasp on fleeting youth,
To challenge Time's relentless, ruthless role,
And snatch you from Decay's insidious tooth.
   In love's sweet battle, I shall not retreat,
   I'll graft new life, as Time and Decay seethe.

"
15,3,"When mulling over life's abundant grace,
I find all blooms have moments they must yield;
This world's vast stage presents a fleeting race,
Where stars and planets on our fates impel.
As plants grow strong, then fade, so humans rise,
In youth exultant, in decay they droop,
Their vibrant days and beauty swiftly flies,
Leaving behind a longing, wistful group.
This thought ignites a war within my breast,
A fight to keep the ones I love so dear,
To challenge Time and Decay's ruthless quest,
And shield you from the shadows drawing near.
   And thus, in love's defiant, warring strife,
   I'll graft new life, as Time consumes your life."
16,1,"Yet why do you not challenge this fierce foe,
Time's cruel reign, with strength beyond my verse?
In your own dwindling, find a way to grow,
A bulwark stronger than my humble curse.
Perched now atop life's joyous peaks you stand,
And many a fertile field, unplowed by hand,
Would gladly bear your image, true and grand,
More real than gilded copies can.
So too, the lines of life, by time outlined,
Or by my hand in verse, can never be
As true to you as when you are designed
By your own essence, plain for all to see.
  To lose yourself is to retain your soul,
  And you will live, through artful self-control.

"
16,2,"But why not then confront this ruthless enemy,
This tyrant Time, with a more potent force,
And in your own decline find remedy,
More powerful than my simple verse's course?
Now poised upon the pinnacle of glee,
And many a maiden meadow, unadorned,
Yearns to bring to life your form, in purity,
More genuine than any art can spawn.
Thus, lines of life, by Time or me inscribed,
Cannot compare with what your heart can show,
In self-drawn form, no skill can be so precise,
As that which springs from your own inner glow.
  To let yourself go is to truly live,
  And through your art, your spirit shall survive.

"
16,3,"So why, I wonder, do you not defy
This oppressive lord, Time, with ampler might,
And in your own decline, learn to rely
On solace stronger than my written rite?
Now balanced on the summit of delight,
And many a maiden glade, untouched by hand,
Would fain bring forth your form, in purest light,
More real than any imitation's hand.
So, lines of life, by Time or me inscribed,
Cannot match the truth your essence holds,
In self-drawn form, no artifice can hide,
The beauty that your heart and soul enfolds.
  To lose yourself is to discover grace,
  And through your art, you'll find your resting place."
17,1,"In future ages, who would credit my song
If I detailed each virtue you possess?
Though now, by heaven, 'tis but dimly shown,
Like a faint star your brilliance still impress.
If I could pen the azure of your gaze
And count anew each charm that graces you,
The world would cry, ""This poet tells but praise,
No face on earth could claim such heavenly hue.""
My parchment, yellowed by the sun's embrace,
Would be dismissed, as ancient men deceive,
And your true worth, they'd say, is but a chase,
A bard's wild dream, no more, they'd believe.
  Yet, should a child of yours inherit earth,
  You'd live again, through progeny and mirth.

"
17,2,"When future years have passed, who'd trust my word
To sing your praises, so divine and bright?
Though now, alas, but shadows are conferred,
Your worth in whispers, hidden from the light.
If I could paint the hue of your dear smile
And sing anew each grace that decks your soul,
The ages hence would deem it all a style,
A poet's touch, no more, they'd take control.
My verses, aged, would gather dust and sneers,
Like elders' tales, less true than first believed,
And your true worth, they'd say, is but a veneer,
A fancied thing, no more, by bards conceived.
  But if, by chance, a child of yours remains,
  Your spirit lives, through them and my refrains.

"
17,3,"When ages turn and time has passed along,
Who'd heed my voice, recounting your great worth?
Though now, it's true, but shadows are prolonged,
Your virtues veiled, concealed from common earth.
If I could sketch the emerald of your heart
And celebrate each trait that graces you,
The future minds would think it but a part,
A poet's tale, no more, they'd turn adieu.
My lines, grown old, would fade like morning mist,
Like ancients' fables, less than true they'd find,
And your true value, they'd declare, is amiss,
A fleeting thought, no more, by bards designed.
  Yet, should a scion of your blood take flight,
  Your essence lives, through them and rhythm's light."
18,1,"Ought I to liken you to a day in spring?
You are more graceful, and your touch is soothing.
Wild gusts may stir the blossoms of everything,
Yet spring's embrace is fleeting.
Sometimes too bright shines the sun's all-seeing gaze,
And often its radiance fades from view;
All beauty wanes, in various ways and ways,
By chance or nature's shifting hue.
But your everlasting spring shall never fade,
Nor shall it yield what rightfully is yours,
Nor shall the specter of Death be displayed,
When in eternal verse you bloom once more.
  As long as hearts can yearn or souls can roam,
  This verse shall live, and you'll never be alone.

"
18,2,"Should I equate you to an autumn's gentle sigh?
You are more vibrant, and your whispers are soft.
Storms may harass the leaves that flutter by,
Still, autumn's allure is aloft.
At times, the sky weeps, obscuring the sun,
And often its warmth is hidden from sight;
All splendor fades, as day is overcome,
By twilight's enchanting, subtle light.
But your eternal autumn shall not wane,
Nor lose its grasp on beauty that it holds,
Nor shall the reaper's somber claim contain,
The tale of valor that your spirit told.
  So long as minds can dream or spirits soar,
  This poem lives, and your legacy endures.

"
18,3,"May I assimilate you to a winter's calm?
You are more serene, and your quiet is deep.
Beneath the stars, the snowy world transform,
In slumber, secrets the earth does keep.
Harsh winds may howl, yet cannot breach,
The fortress of tranquility you've made;
Though short-lived, winter's grasp does reach,
To every corner, where shadows are laid.
But your eternal winter shall not cease,
Nor lose its hold on peace that it possess,
Nor shall the frost's encroaching spread increase,
The fortitude found in your steadfastness.
  While time still turns and worlds take form and flight,
  This verse shall burn, a beacon in the night."
19,1,"Biting Time, blunt thou the lion's claws
And make Earth consume her own dear offspring;
Pluck the sharp fangs from the tiger's fierce jaws,
And incinerate the ancient phoenix's wing.
Scatter joy and sorrow as you take flight
And do as you will, swift-paced Time,
To the vast world and all her fleeting delights.
But I forbid one grievous act from thee:
O, etch not with your hours my love's smooth face,
Nor trace no furrows there with your old quill;
Let him in your path remain untouched,
A timeless beauty for future hearts to fill.
Still, do your worst, old Time; in spite of your harm,
My love shall in my words forever be warm.

"
19,2,"Consuming Time, blunt thou the lion's grasp
And make the Earth swallow her own tender fruit;
Tear the sharp claws from the tiger's fierce grasp,
And cremate the long-lived phoenix in its root.
Bring gladness and sorrow as you take stride
And do what you wish, swift-moving Time,
To the wide universe and all her passing pride.
But I forbid one wicked deed from you:
O, mar not with your moments my love's bright visage,
Nor engrave no wrinkles there with your ancient tool;
Keep him unscathed in your endless race,
A pristine beauty for future minds to rule.
Yet, do your worst, old Time; despite your cruel hand,
My love shall in my verses forever stand.

"
19,3,"Claiming Time, blunt thou the lion's hold
And make the Earth reclaim her own lovely spawn;
Rip the sharp talons from the tiger's stronghold,
And scorch the long-lived phoenix in its dawn.
Scatter joy and sadness as you swiftly glide
And do what you desire, swift-gliding Time,
To the broad world and all her transient pride.
But I forbid one monstrous sin from you:
O, etch not with your hours my love's gentle brow,
Nor mark no lines there with your hoary pen;
Spare him from your touch in your endless flow,
A flawless beauty for future eyes to ken.
Still, do your worst, old Time; in spite of your scorn,
My love shall in my lines forever be reborn."
20,1,"A visage feminine, by Nature's art adorned,
You hold, my ruling passion's sovereign;
A tender heart in women's stead, unsworn
To fickle whims like those of mortal women.
Brighter than theirs is your observant gaze,
Less deceptive in its following path;
In your command, all colors have their days,
Entrancing minds and captivating both.
First shaped for womankind, you were, until
Nature, in her crafting, fell bewitched;
By your addition, my intent she killed
With a nothingness she could not hitch.
Yet, since for women's delight you're made,
Take my love; let them keep the charade.

"
20,2,"A lady's countenance, by Nature's hand engraved,
You are, my sole obsession's captain;
A gentle soul in feminine form, uncraved
By fleeting trends, as false women's habit.
Bright stars outshine the lesser lights they cast,
More honest in their revolution's trace;
A spectrum's lord, in you, they're bound and tied,
Mesmerizing souls and captivating gaze.
Initially designed for women's allure,
Till Nature, smitten, fell to adoration;
With your addition, she my purpose obscure,
By adding one, and thus creating naught.
Still, as you're fashioned for their admiration,
Take my love; their treasure, your devotion.

"
20,3,"A face of womanhood, by Nature's touch imbued,
You are, my sole desire's commander;
A tender heart, in feminine guise, unloosed
From fleeting shifts, as changeable women's manner.
A gaze that outshines theirs, less prone to feign,
Gilding the object of its fascination;
A hue to rule all hues, in you contained,
Entrancing hearts and captivating adoration.
First shaped for women's joy, you were, until
Nature, in her work, fell powerless;
By your addition, she my purpose nullified,
By adding one, and thus creating emptiness.
Yet, as you're meant for women's purest pleasure,
Take my love; their treasure, your true measure."
21,1,"In similitude, my muse and I partake
Of inspirations drawn from beauty's grace,
Where heaven's adornments for adornment make
A match of equals in the vast embrace.
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich treasure,
With spring's initial blooms and rarities,
I find my words entwined in love's sweet pleasure,
Comparing thee to nature's majesties.
Believe me, my love, when I say with truth,
Thy beauty equals that of heaven's heirs,
Though not as stars, in firmament aloof,
Thy worth outshines their cold and distant flares.
  Let others sing the praises they desire;
  I'll celebrate the love that I inspire.

"
21,2,"As poets wooed by beauty's allure,
Our muse and I find kindred inspiration,
Where heaven's ornaments and earthly lure
Blend in a dance of sweet creation.
With celestial bodies, gems, and flowers,
I sing of love that knows no equal peer,
A bond of hearts entwined like ivy towers,
Adorning each other's presence dear.
My love, I pen my words with honesty,
For thou art fair as any child of light,
Though not as stars, whose brilliance I can't see,
Thine eyes outshine their distant, cold respite.
  Let others claim the praises they prefer;
  My song is thine, and thine alone, my ver.

"
21,3,"With ardor kindled by a muse divine,
I join the poet's chorus, singing praise,
Where heaven's ornaments and earth entwine
In splendid tapestry of loved-filled days.
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
With spring's first blossoms and celestial fire,
I find my heart's refrain in love's sweet hymns,
Comparing thee to nature's truest lyre.
My love, I write with fidelity,
For thou art fair as any heaven's sphere,
Though not as stars, whose distant glow I see,
Thy love outshines their cold and distant cheer.
  Let others raise their voices to acclaim;
  My heart's song is for thee, in love's sweet name."
22,1,"My crystal gaze does not concede age,
While youth and you share the same hourglass,
But when your visage bears time's ravage,
I see death's claim upon my fleeting hours' pass.
For all the beauty cloaking your form,
Is but the gracious shroud of my soul's core,
Which in your spirit dwells, as mine in you transforms,
How then may I be ancient before?
Oh, thus, sweetheart, guard thyself with caution,
As I, for your sake, shall bear the cost,
Cherishing your heart, with vigilance cautioned,
As a devoted nurse would her cherished host.
  Fear not to claim my heart, for it is thine,
  Given freely, and never to rescind.

"
22,2,"My looking glass cannot deceive, nor lie,
Yet as long as youth and you both coincide,
It whispers not of age, nor tells me nigh,
The moment when our shared years must divide.
When furrows etched by Time I chance to witness,
In your fair countenance, then to myself I say,
My days are numbered, and soon I'll be remiss,
In keeping pace with you, who hold them at bay.
The beauty gracing your visage, so bright,
Is but the resplendent veil of my own heart,
Which in your tender care, finds sweet delight,
In every beat, a testament of our start.
  So, love, protect yourself, as I shall thee,
  Our hearts entwined, forever wild and free.

"
22,3,"My mirror's truth does not yet show my age,
While we, in the bloom of youth, remain united,
But when your face, by Time's cruel hand engaged,
Reveals the years, I too shall feel affrighted.
For all the charm that clothes your form divine,
Is but the gilded casing of my heart's true grace,
Which in your breast does dwell, and intertwine,
A dance of love, that time cannot erase.
How then could I, in this union, age,
When every glance, each touch, revives our bond?
Love, let us vow, with hearts on every page,
To stand as one, through Time's relentless march, beyond.
  Preserve your heart, as I shall mine,
  Two souls entwined, forever thine, forever mine."
23,1,"Like a flawed thespian on the stage,
Afraid, his role left in the wings;
Or fierce, too much force in his gauge,
His might overwhelming, heart it stings.
So I, in love's dread, forget the verse,
My strength becomes my own defeat,
Overwhelmed, I begin to rehearse
The crumbling sonnet at my feet.
Let now my writings speak my heart,
Silent ambassadors they'll be,
Ardor and yearning to impart,
A love-language, wild and free.
In love's fine wit, with eyes, discern
The silent sonnets we've yet to learn.

"
23,2,"As an unpolished player on the scene,
With dread contending for his part,
Or something fierce, its rage extreme,
Weakened by strength, tearing it apart.
So I, in love's terror, fail to say
The sacred words of love's own rite,
In love's own might, I start to fray,
Overwhelmed, I lose my sight.
Oh, let my written words speak truth,
Messengers of my heart's deep plea,
Beyond the tongue, they'll find their youth,
A love-story waiting to be.
In love's fine art, with eyes, perceive
The silent sonnets we have yet to conceive.

"
23,3,"Like a hesitant performer on the platform,
His fear usurping lines destined for his heart,
Or something fierce, consumed by its own diagram,
Strength's excess, a weakness to impart.
So I, in love's anxiety, forget to convey
The well-rehearsed liturgy of love's own dance,
In love's own power, I start to fray,
Overcharged, I lose my chance.
Oh, let my written words be the evidence,
Silent heralds of my heart's true quest,
Speaking for love, no need for recompense,
A tale of love, passionally expressed.
In love's fine sense, with eyes, discern
The silent sonnets we have yet to learn."
24,1,"Through my gaze, your form in my heart's table is laid,
A frame of flesh holds the beauty you've made.
Perspective, the painter's finest skill,
In my heart's canvas, your image is displayed.

To perceive the art, one must see the artist's hand,
In my heart, your portrait remains, forever grand.
Through my eyes, a window to my core,
Your reflection graces what was before.

My sight captured your essence, you mirrored mine,
Two frames of vision, a bond divine.
Yet, our eyes, though clever, cannot fathom the soul,
Two windows, revealing but never make whole.

Though sight plays its part, it cannot truly impart,
The depth of the heart, forever separate.

"
24,2,"My eye, the artist, has captured your grace,
In my heart's gallery, you have a place.
Framed by my body, your beauty resides,
Perspective, the brushstroke that carefully hides.

The painter's art, in my heart, you'll find,
A true image of you, forever enshrined.
Eyes, the windows, reveal the artist's intent,
In my heart, your portrait, lovingly lent.

Eyes for eyes, a mirror's exchange,
In this dance of vision, we rearrange.
My sight captures your form, your vision, my art,
Two frames of affection, tearing down walls apart.

Yet, our eyes, though they see, cannot reach within,
Two windows that witness, but never truly win.

"
24,3,"My eye, the painter, has sketched your delight,
In my heart's gallery, you are the light.
Framed by my being, your beauty I keep,
Perspective, the veil, in which it's concealed deep.

The painter's craft, in my heart, is unfurled,
A true image of you, in this hidden world.
Eyes, the windows, reveal the artist's creation,
In my heart, your portrait, in admiration.

Eyes for eyes, a reflection's play,
In this dance of vision, we sway.
My sight captures your essence, your vision, my art,
Two frames of affection, drawing us apart.

Yet, our eyes, though they see, cannot grasp the soul,
Two windows that witness, but never take control."
25,1,"Let those who bask in popular acclaim,
With high renown and titles' glittering show,
Exult, while I, denied such fleeting fame,
Find joy in that which humbly gleams below.
Great leaders' cronies may their flags unfurl
Yet like the sunflower to the sun they turn,
In their own hearts, their pride and scorn conceal,
For at a whisper, their brightness shall unlearn.
The valiant soldier, bathed in well-earned praise,
After one fall, his honored name effaced,
And all his past triumphs fade to mist,
Lost to the world, for which he deeply raced.
  Content I stand, in love both strong and true,
  Unyielding, neither parted nor pursued.

"
25,2,"Let those adorned with worldly praise and fame,
In public view, their laurels they display,
While I, unblessed by fortune's fickle game,
Discover joy in love's unending ray.
The courtier's favor blooms like daisy's face,
But turns from sun as transient as can be,
In their own hearts, their pride and scorn concealed,
For at a frown, their brightness fades away.
The gallant warrior, honored and admired,
One failure sees his glory fade to gray,
From history's scroll, his name erased quite,
Lost to the world, for which he fiercely strayed.
  In love I find my solace, pure and bright,
  Unmoved, unmovable, forever tight.

"
25,3,"Let those in favor with their stars rejoice,
With titles' glamour and the crowd's applause,
While I, unblessed by fickle fortune's voice,
Discover joy in love's eternal cause.
The noble's cronies may their banners fly,
Yet like the tulip to the sun they lean,
In their own hearts, their pride and scorn concealed,
For at a whisper, their brightness is serene.
The courageous fighter, honored and esteemed,
One loss undoes his thousand victories' sum,
From history's page, his name is torn away,
Lost to the world, for which he bravely run.
  In love I dwell, forever fixed and sound,
  Unshaken, unshakeable, forever bound."
26,1,"Sovereign of my heart, in fealty bound,
Your worth has made my loyalty resolute,
To you I send this missive, not unsound,
A testament to duty, not my repute;
A duty so profound, my meager skill
May make it seem diminished, words inadequate,
But in your mind's embrace, bare and illimitable,
I trust you'll grant it audience, truly appreciate;
Until the guiding star of my journey's end
Bestows upon my love a fitting garment,
A gracious aspect, mending what was rent,
Revealing worthiness of your high ornament.
  Then may I proudly claim the love I bear,
  Until then, silent, lest you find me wanting.

"
26,2,"Master of my affection, bound by pledge,
Your virtue has ensnared my fealty tight,
To you I dispatch this letter, not a wedge,
A tribute to my duty, not a contest of insight;
A duty so immense, my humble art
May render it unseen, in language poor and slight,
But in your soul's vast chamber, open and bright,
I trust you'll find its essence, pure and smart;
Until the leading star of my uncertain path
Shines kindly on my love, adorned and chaste,
And cloaks my tattered devotion in aftermath,
Revealing worthiness of your esteemed grace.
  Then may I boldly speak of love's embrace,
  Until then, hushed, I'll hide within your space.

"
26,3,"Lord of my devotion, by allegiance sworn,
Your virtue has forged my duty's chain,
To you I pen this message, not forlorn,
A token of loyalty, not a claim to fame;
A loyalty so grand, my feeble voice
May falter in expression, lacking words to gain,
But in your heart's deep well, clear and plain,
I trust you'll glimpse its truth, beyond alloy and choice;
Until the guiding light of my uncertain quest
Illuminates my love, restored and neat,
And casts a worthy glow upon my unconfessed,
Adequate at last to your discerning seat.
  Then may I sing of love, without disguise,
  Until then, I'll wait, concealed in your skies."
27,1,"Exhausted by labor, I hasten to my rest,
The sweet respite for limbs by journey weary,
But then begins a new sojourn in my chest
Where thoughts take flight, unfettered and cheery.
For now my heart, from realms quite far away,
Yearns to embark on a fervent quest,
And keeps my heavy eyelids in assay,
Gazing on darkness, as the blind do attest.
Yet, my soul's inner vision, clear and bright,
Reveals thy form in night's shadowy veil,
A gem amidst the darkness, shining so bright,
Transforming gloom to beauty, failure to hail.
In day, my limbs tire; in night, my mind,
Both for thee and for myself, no peace they find.

"
27,2,"Drained by tasks, I hurry to my resting place,
The blissful retreat for limbs grown weary,
But then commences a different sort of chase
In the realm of thought, where mind's wander free.
From distant lands, my thoughts, with ardor, roam,
Seeking thee, their ultimate desire,
And rouse my sleepy eyelids from their gloam,
Gazing on darkness, as the lonely tire.
My soul's inner light, though, shines anew,
Illuminating night's enveloping shroud,
Revealing thee, as stars their brilliance strew,
A beacon, guiding through the crowd.
By day, my body aches; by night, my mind,
Both for thee and for myself, no peace they find.

"
27,3,"Weary from strain, I hasten to my bed,
The welcome haven for limbs that ache,
But then, within my mind, a different thread
Of thought emerges, no longer fatigued.
For now, my mind, from far-off lands,
Journeys to thee, its longed-for destination,
And keeps my heavy eyelids in its hands,
Gazing on darkness, as the lonely imagine.
Yet, my soul's inner eye, awake and keen,
Paints thy visage on the canvas of night,
A masterpiece concealed, but evergreen,
A treasure hidden from the common sight.
By day, my limbs are spent; by night, my mind,
Both for thee and for myself, no calm they find."
28,1,"How might I find my way to cheerful bliss,
Denied the solace of a moment's peace,
When day's relentless grip does not dismiss
The weight of burden, granting no release?
In tandem, day and night, conspire and weave
A tormented tapestry of woe,
Where one by toil and other by reprieve
Extends the reach of anguish's shadow.
I speak to day of your celestial light,
A balm when storms obscure the azure sky;
In turn, I soothe the dusky, starless night,
Extolling your bright presence 'neath its pall.
  Yet day by day, my sorrows stretch and grow,
  And night by night, my heart's despair doth sow.

"
28,2,"Can I regain my joy, ensnared in strife,
Deprived of respite from the daily grind?
As day's harsh rule extends through endless life,
Night's dark veil brings no surcease to find.
In league, they join to plague and to afflict,
Day, with its labor, and night, with its moan,
Together, they conspire to obstruct,
My path to you, through suffering, they've sown.
I whisper to day of your brilliance fair,
A solace when skies weep and storms do rage;
To night, I sing of your tranquil care,
When stars abandon the sable page.
  Yet day by day, my sorrows deepen and widen,
  And night by night, my heart's despair is heightened.

"
28,3,"How may I then attain a blissful state,
Denied the comfort of a moment's rest?
When day's oppressive hand does not abate,
But day by night and night by day, molest.
In league, they stand, to wreak their cruel spite,
Day, with its toil, and night, with its despair,
Together, they conspire to blight my sight,
And lead me further from your tender care.
I tell the day of your resplendent glow,
A refuge when the storms assail the skies;
To night, I speak of your serene tableau,
When stars abandon the sable skies.
  But day by day, my sorrows intensify,
  And night by night, my heart's despair draws nigh."
29,1,"In misfortune's shadow, scorned by fate's decree,
My solitary woes to heavens I raise,
Voiceless, my pleas in vain, no respite see,
My destiny I mourn in dismal haze.
Envious I stand, yearning for hope's embrace,
Features of others I'd adopt as my own,
Their talents craved, with friends their hearts efface,
With what I cherish most, still unfulfilled, longing.
Yet, in this sorrow, thoughts of thee arise,
Lifting my spirit, like the lark's ascent,
From sorrow's depth, my soul soars towards skies,
Singing hymns of joy, my heart's contentment.
For love's sweet memory grants such richness,
I'd not exchange my state for kings' dominance.

"
29,2,"Tarnished by fortune, shunned by mortal gaze,
Alone, I mourn my banished circumstance,
Defiant, I cry out to the unlistening skies,
In disdain, I curse my luck, my bitter chance.
A heart that longs for hope's resplendent grace,
A visage like his, friends, his life's abundance,
His skill I crave, his reach, his given space,
With my own joy, I find the least content.
In this despair, I ponder thee, and rise,
Emerging from darkness, soaring to the heights,
Like dawn's lark, my soul ascends, and surprise,
I sing at heaven's gate, through the encumbering nights.
For love's sweet recollection brings true wealth,
I'd not forsake it, for a king's own health.

"
29,3,"Disgraced, fortune turns her back on me,
Abandoned, I bewail my plighted state,
Cries for mercy lost, no answer finds the plea,
My fate I loathe, at heaven's cold gate.
Seeking the richness of another's hope,
Features of one, friendships of yet another,
His art, his scope, the life I yearn to cope,
With my own joy, I'm still the poorest brother.
Despite this self-disdain, I find release,
In thoughts of thee, my spirit takes its flight,
Ascending from the depths, like dawn's increase,
The lark, I sing, at heaven's gate, pure light.
For love's sweet memory grants true grace,
I'd not exchange my state, for kingly place."
30,1,"Unto the chambers of quiet rumination,
I call upon the echoes of times past,
And mourn the loss of dreams yet to be found,
In sighs and tears, my fleeting moments cast.
I cast my gaze upon the darkened stream,
For comrades lost in night's eternal hold,
And weep anew the pain of love's farewell,
A mournful song of sights no more behold.
I mourn the wounds of ancient strife once more,
And in my woe, recount the tales of old,
As if the debt of sorrow I'd not paid,
Yet, if I think on thee, dear friend, such woe
Is lifted, and the balm of solace flows,
Restoring all that time had claimed before.

"
30,2,"To the sanctuary of still thoughts, I summon
The whispers of the yesteryears gone by,
Lamenting the unfound treasures I have sought,
With tears and sighs, I bid my time's goodbye.
I turn my gaze to the river of oblivion,
To find the faces of the dear departed,
In fresh-drawn tears, I mourn the love once known,
A melody of loss, forever chanted.
I grieve the wounds of battles long forgotten,
And in my sorrow, I retell the tale,
As if the hurt of loss I've yet to pay,
But when I think of thee, dear friend, all aches
Fade 'neath the soothing balm of sweet recall,
And all the losses fade into the past.

"
30,3,"Within the halls of silent, sweet remembrance,
I conjure forth the shadows of the past,
And lament the loss of joys I longed to grasp,
With tears and sighs, my fleeting moments cast.
I seek the faces of the absent friends,
Concealed in darkness of the endless night,
And weep anew the bitter tears of love,
A mournful song, a vanished sight in sight.
I mourn the wounds of ancient grievances,
And in my woe, I recount the tales of old,
As if the debt of sorrow I've not paid,
Yet, if I think on thee, dear friend, such woe
Is lifted, and the balm of solace flows,
Restoring all that time had claimed before."
31,1,"Your breast cherishes all hearts
I once believed were lost, absent, departed,
In you, love and its every part
By my absence, never truly departed.

How many a tear, sacred and unbidden,
Has love, so deep, from my eyes stolen,
As interest for the dead, now awakened,
No longer hidden, but in you lie golden.

You are the crypt where love finds life anew,
Adorned with relics of my lovers past,
Whose every piece of me, I once did strew,
Now rightfully thine, a love amassed.
   In you, their images I cherish yet,
   And you, their love, have become my all's debt.

"
31,2,"Embraced by hearts your bosom holds,
Once lost to me, now alive and bold,
Love and its fervent, tender mold
Blooms in you, a garden of the old.

Dear love has stolen tears from my sight,
As tribute to the absent, now in light,
Hidden no more, but held in your tight,
Grateful embrace, a sacred, warming light.

You are the shrine where love finds its place,
Adorned with memories of my lovers' grace,
Their echoes in you, I embrace,
A union of love in time and space.
   Within you, I find their love again,
   And you, their love, are now my own domain.

"
31,3,"Your heart bears witness to love's rebirth,
Once thought gone, now found in you, of worth,
Love and its kindred, rich and fervent girth,
Reignite in you, a sacred, glowing hearth.

Tears of love, once shed in mourning's guise,
Now transformed, in your presence, arise,
As tribute to the lost, awakening skies,
In you, their spirits, forever surprise.

You are the vessel of love's delight,
Adorned with echoes of my lovers' flight,
Their whispers in you, I hold tight,
A symphony of love, soaring in flight.
   Within you, their memories live anew,
   And you, their love, forever pursue."
32,1,"Should fate grant you to outlive my final breath,
When Death's harsh scythe cuts down and claims my form,
And should you chance upon this humble wreath
Of words, left in my stead to keep you warm;
Compare them to the verse of present days,
Though they may falter in the face of new,
Preserve them for the sentiment I gave,
In honor of the love that once was true.
Then ponder on this thought, so tenderly:
""Had he lived longer, borne the age's fruit,
A greater gift than this his heart might see
To stand among the ranks of poetic sleuth.
  Yet, as he left us and poets rise anew,
  I'll cherish his for love, theirs for their due.""

"
32,2,"If time should pass and I am laid to rest,
While you remain, enduring life's vast play,
Gaze once again on these, my humble quest,
These lines, the echo of my bygone day.
Though other bards may claim the laurel crown,
And leave my humble verse in distant shade,
Keep them for love, and let the thought resound:
""His words, though simple, honest love conveyed.""
Consider then, with kind and gentle grace:
""Might he have bloomed, had he but more sun?
A nobler work from his fond heart to grace,
To join the ranks where songs and sonnets run.
  But death claimed him, and new voices sing,
  I'll treasure his for love, theirs for their bling.""

"
32,3,"When I am gone and you remain above,
Reflect on these, my lines, in quiet hour,
And let your mind traverse the tender love
Expressed in every word, each fleeting power.
Though rival quills may claim the victor's prize,
These words remain, bound to the love they share,
So judge them not by poetic guise,
But for the truth in passion they declare.
Pause for a moment, let your heart reply:
""Had he been gifted years, his soul unfurled,
A masterwork, a testament, would fly,
To stand among the greats, in brightness twirled.
  Yet death took him, and new voices rise,
  I'll keep his words for love, theirs for their prize."""
33,1,"How oft I've marveled at resplendent dawn,
Where sunlight graces mountaintops so high,
Bestowing gold on fields, where they are drawn,
And making sacred rivers 'neath the sky.
But then, alas, the lowly clouds take flight,
Obscuring with their forms his glorious face,
And from our sight, he vanishes out of sight,
Retreating to the west without a trace.
So too, my love, once shone upon my head,
A brilliant light to chase away all gloom,
Yet swiftly taken, like the morning's bread,
Replaced by clouds that herald impending doom.
  Yet still, I cherish that celestial flame,
  For worldly suns may fade, but not his name.

"
33,2,"I've witnessed countless mornings, bright and clear,
When sunbeams graced the mountaintops with glee,
Anointing verdant meadows far and near,
Transforming streams in sacred alchemy.
Then enters ugliest clouds, a motley crew,
To mar the visage of the skies above,
Concealing from our sight that glorious hue,
Departing hence, cloaked by their darkened robe.
My love, once beaming like the radiant sun,
Bestowed its warmth on my unworthy soul,
But, all too soon, the fleeting moment's done,
Replaced by shadows, stealing my control.
  Yet, not for this, my heart shall e'er disdain,
  The sun, though masked, still burns with ardent flame.

"
33,3,"Innumerable mornings, I have seen
The golden sun adorn the mountaintops,
Bestowing grace on fields of vibrant green,
And making holy rivers where they drop.
But then, the basest clouds do take their stand,
To mar the sun's fair face with dark omens,
Concealing from our eyes that glorious land,
And stealing to the west, forsaking men.
My love, once bright as heaven's own shining star,
Bestowed its light on my unworthy heart,
Yet, like the sun, it moved too swiftly far,
Obscured by clouds, and never to restart.
  Yet still, I treasure that celestial boon,
  For worldly lights may fade, but not his moon."
34,1,"Why did you pledge such a radiant day,
And have me journey forth without my shawl,
To let dismal clouds in my pathway stray,
Obscuring your valor in their murky pall?
Merely unveiling through the cloud your face
To dry the rain on my damp-soaked attire,
Is not enough to heal the sting and disgrace,
Nor can your guilt alleviate my dire.
Even if you repent, I've still the cost,
Of the offender's sorrow, feeble is the boon.
But the pearls of tears your love doth toss,
Are riches that atone for every ill-done.

"
34,2,"How could you vow a day of pure delight,
And leave me to the mercy of the skies?
The clouds, like traitors, block the sun's bright light,
And hide your courage 'neath their darkened guise.
You may emerge from shadows, clear the rain,
Yet healing balm you offer brings me scant ease,
For what good is solace if the pain
Persists and stings like an unslackened breeze?
Your regret may soothe, but cannot restore,
The loss I bear, the cross of deep offense.
Yet, precious as pearls, your tears do pour,
And they hold worth to absolve your innocence.

"
34,3,"Why guarantee a day of golden hue,
Then leave me to the storm without my shield?
The clouds, they rise, and shadows they ensue,
Concealing your gallantry like a field.
You may emerge through clouds, the rain may cease,
Yet comfort brings no cure to my despair.
For how can balm assuage the heart's increase
Of anguish, if the wound remains laid bare?
Your remorse may soothe, but cannot undo,
The loss I've suffered, the cross of your offense.
Yet, as pearls, your tears of love ensue,
A treasure that atones for your transgression."
35,1,"Relinquish sorrow for the past's deed,
For roses bear thorns, and clear fountains, mud;
Lunar eclipses mar cosmic decree,
And unsightly blights inhabit the blossom stud.
All beings err, and I, too, in this,
Sanctioning thy transgression with likeness,
My own virtue tainted, healing thy bliss,
Pardoning thy sins beyond their trueitness.
In witness to thine indulgent offense,
My opposition turns advocate,
A lawful plea against myself commence.
Such strife exists 'twixt love and irate,
That I, an ally, must join the fray,
To that sweet thief who steals me away.

"
35,2,"Cast off mourning for the acts once done,
As roses possess thorns, and purest rills, mud;
Stars obscured by clouds, the sun, eclipsed, one;
Decay dwells in the loveliest of bud.
All mortals falter, I, too, in this fault,
Lending credence to thine error's sway,
Myself corrupted, mending thy default,
Excusing thy sins more than they weigh.
For to thine illicit love I lend mind,
Thine adversary, my defense, takes form,
And a just plea against me, they find.
Such civil strife in my heart is born,
That I, an accomplice, must partake,
In the sweet theft that my heart does forsake.

"
35,3,"Banish grief for the past's misdeed,
For roses have thorns, and crystal streams, mud;
Clouds mar the sky, and the moon's face is stained,
And decay dwells in the sweetest of bud.
All souls falter, and I, too, am askew,
Comparing thy transgression to my own,
Sanctioning thy trespass, I corrupt anew,
Pardoning thy sins, more than they are known.
For to thine illicit touch I concede,
Thy foe, my advocate, takes the stand,
A lawful plea against me, they read.
Such discord exists 'twixt love and disdain,
That I, an accomplice, must engage,
In the sweet theft that my heart does estrange."
36,1,"Confess, you and I are twain,
Two souls entwined by love's sweet chain;
Our shared affection's single strain,
Despite life's gulf, remains untamed.

Two hearts in love's embrace, yet part,
One respect, yet separate plight;
Divided, steal the sweetest art,
From love's delight, out of sight.

I cannot claim our love confessed,
Lest guilt's dark shadow mar thy name;
Nor canst thou grace me with thy zest,
Unless thou robs thy honor's claim.

Preserve thy name, I beg, for love,
As thine, so is my spirit's dove.

"
36,2,"Acknowledge, we must bear the mark,
Of separate souls, yet love the same;
Our spirits share a single spark,
Amid life's storm, they remain aflame.

Two bodies, one in love entwined,
Yet separate, life's cruel jest;
In love, one heart, one mind,
Apart, we suffer love's unrest.

I cannot claim our love combined,
Lest guilt's dark veil obscures thy light;
Nor canst thou share in love's design,
Unless you cast away its blight.

Let love's pure name remain unstained,
In love, our honor is maintained.

"
36,3,"Recognize, our souls are two,
Yet one in love's eternal fire;
Two flames may dance, but share one hue,
Despite the distance, they aspire.

Two hearts in love's sweet symphony,
Divided, yet together beat;
In love, one song, one melody,
Apart, life's bitter, love's retreat.

I cannot claim our love embraced,
Lest guilt's dark wings obscure thy grace;
Nor canst thou share in love's sweet chase,
Unless you leave its disgrace.

In love, our names in harmony,
Two souls, one love's sweet legacy."
37,1,"As a wizened sire finds joy in his child's might,
Delighting in their energy and feats of youth,
So I, by fortune's dearest plight made lame,
Find solace in your worth and veritable truth.

For whether beauty, birth, or riches adorn,
Or wisdom graces you, or all combined,
In your being, I find love reborn,
Engrafted to this treasure I find signed.

So then, I stand not lame nor poor, nor slighted,
While this reflection grants such substance bright,
In your abundance, I am amply lighted,
And by a piece of all your splendor alight.

Seek what is best, that best I wish for thee,
This wish I hold, then tenfold blessed am I.

"
37,2,"Like a weathered sage who gazes at his scion's might,
Finding joy in youthful acts and strength reborn,
So I, by fate's dearest spite made frail and lame,
Discover solace in your worth, your truth well-known.

For if it's beauty, birth, or wealth that graces thee,
Or wit adorns your brow, or all combined,
In your essence, love's new life I see,
Engrafted to this wealth, I find it signed.

Thus, I am not lame nor poor, nor cast aside,
While this reflection grants such substance gleaming,
In your abundance, I find pride,
And by a fragment of your glory, I am beaming.

Choose what is best, that best I wish for thee,
This wish I hold, then tenfold blest I be.

"
37,3,"As a seasoned elder finds delight in a youngster's might,
Reveling in their youthful exploits and verve,
So I, by destiny's dearest spite made weak and lame,
Gather comfort from your worth, your truth I serve.

For if it's beauty, birth, or riches that adorn,
Or wisdom graces you, or all combined,
In your very being, love transforms,
Engrafted to this treasure, I find it signed.

So then, I stand not lame, nor poor, nor cast away,
While this reflection grants such substance glowing,
In your abundance, I find my way,
And by a fragment of your glory, I am growing.

Select what is best, that best I wish for thee,
This wish I hold, then tenfold blessed am I."
38,1,"How can my inspiration seek a theme
When you infuse each line with living breath?
Your matchless wisdom too profound it seems
For common scribes to capture or rephrase.
If any words of mine find favor's grace,
Grant me the honor to have shown your light.
Be hailed as muses ten, whose brilliance bright
Outshines the ancient nine, invoked in haste.
Let those who call upon your sacred name
Produce enduring verse to grace the ages.
If these my humble lines ignite a flame
In hearts of men, let them praise you, not me.
For I but labor, while your glory sings.

"
38,2,"How can I find a muse when you inspire
My soul with fervor, breathing life through verse?
Your brilliance too profound for mortal scribe,
Exceeds all thought, transcends the common universe.
If any words I pen deserve a read,
It's you who grants them worth, illuminates.
Oh, be the tenth muse, your value surpasses
The ancient nine, whom poets vainly celebrate.
Let those who summon you bring forth great art,
Eternal whispers to outlast our time.
If fleeting days find merit in my part,
I'll bear the burden, but the honor thine.
As I but echo, you compose the song.

"
38,3,"How can I seek a muse when you inspire
Each phrase, each thought, with passion pure and bright?
Your wisdom too profound for mortal quill,
Eclipses all, beyond the reach of common sight.
If any words I pen merit acclaim,
It's you who lends them grace, ignites the flame.
Oh, be the tenth muse, your value far above
The ancient nine, whom poets vainly name.
Let those who summon you create anew,
Eternal legacies to grace our age.
If transient days find favor in my hue,
I'll bear the burden, but the triumph thine.
For I but channel, you create the light."
39,1,"Of worth and manners, how can I extol
This entity that forms the better part of me?
In self-praise, what merit do I hold
When lauding you is but lauding thee and me?
To dwell apart, our love unnamed,
A sacrifice to grant what's due;
In absence, pain subsides, tamed
By leisure's touch, sweet solitude.
Time spent in thought, of love deceived,
In longing's throes, sweet moments grieve;
In absence, we learn to be
Two souls entwined in unity.
Through separation, find oneness twin,
Praising the one who dwells within.

"
39,2,"How can I, in my manners, sing your worth,
When you're the essence of my vital core?
In praising self, what value or dearth
Can I bestow, when praising you even more?
For this, we live asunder, love apart,
To grant what's owed, your due alone.
Absence, bittersweet, a heavy heart
Conceals the torment, softening its tone.
In leisure's grasp, time's deception sings,
Of love's sweet dream, a cherished thing.
In absence, we learn to see,
Two souls entangled, wild and free.
Through separation, find unity,
Praising the one who shapes our destiny.

"
39,3,"Of manners and worth, how can I sing your grace,
When you're the melody that echoes in my soul?
In self-praise, what can I embrace,
When extolling you is the ultimate goal?
To live apart, our love unknown,
A tribute paid, your due award.
Absence, harsh and cruel, a heavy stone,
Transforms to solace, time's gentle reward.
In leisure's touch, love's thoughts take flight,
A sweet escape, a starlit night.
In absence, we learn to be,
Two souls entwined in harmony.
Through separation, find unity,
Praising the one who sets our spirits free."
40,1,"Grant me all your affections, my dear, take mine in full.
What do you gain, pray, that you did not possess before?
No newfound love, my dear, for all was yours, to your pull,
Long before this moment, when you claimed even more.

If in receiving my love, you claim love as your prize,
I cannot find fault in using what was once mine.
But woe betide you, should you deceive with guise,
Of affection, when in your heart, you draw a line.

I forgive your theft, sweet bandit of the heart,
Though you've stolen all I had, and left me poor.
Love knows it's a heavier burden to bear,
The pain of a love dishonored, than hate's open sore.

Seducing charm, in which all vice is dressed,
Wound me with your scorn, yet we cannot be enemies.

"
40,2,"Accept, my love, all that I offer, seize my heart's all.
What do you gain, that you did not possess before?
No fresh devotion, my love, for all was thine, in thrall,
Ere this hour struck, when you asked for even more.

If in taking my love, you find love's sweet reward,
I cannot chide you for embracing what was once lent.
But beware, lest in taking, your heart grows hard,
By willful choice of what you once repented.

I pardon your plunder, sweet thief of my trust,
Though you've stolen my wealth, and left me with naught.
Love knows it's a grievous burden to bear,
The cost of a love squandered, more than hate's sharp thought.

Enchanting allure, in which all vice is concealed,
Wound me with your scorn, yet we cannot be adversaries.

"
40,3,"Receive, my love, all that I own, take my heart's entirety.
What do you gain, that you did not possess before?
No novel affection, my love, for all was thine, in propriety,
Ere this union, when you sought for even more.

If in possessing my love, you find love's delight,
I cannot reproach you for cherishing what was once lent.
But take heed, lest in holding, your heart turns cold,
By willful grasp of what you once relinquished.

I absolve your acquisition, sweet thief of my heart's design,
Though you've stolen my fortune, and left me bereft.
Love knows it's a heavy toll to bear,
The loss of a love abandoned, more than spite's brief theft.

Captivating charm, in which all vice is enshrined,
Wound me with your scorn, yet we cannot be estranged."
41,1,"The alluring faults of freedom's play,
When I'm away, they dance around your heart,
Your charm and grace, in perfect harmony,
Temptation's steps, with you, never depart.
Kindness defines you, thus, to be embraced,
Beauty adorns you, thus, to be adored,
And when a soul succumbs, no soul's trace
Can turn away until love is scored.
Oh, could you but resist, and understand,
The power in your eyes, the allure of youth,
That drags us to the edge, expands the band
Of truth we share, and severs verity's tooth:
  Hers, by your beauty drawing her anew,
  Thine, by your beauty, false, to me untrue.

"
41,2,"The captivating errors liberty makes,
When I'm astray, they haunt your heart's embrace,
Your elegance and age, in rhythmic beats,
Temptation's song, with you, never abates.
Gentle you are, and thus, to be desired,
Beautiful you are, and thus, to be sought,
And when a heart yearns, no heart's fire retires,
Until it has, what it yearns, it has bought.
Ah, might you but pause, and comprehend,
The spell of your smile, the charm of your youth,
That lures us to the brink, extends the trend
Of truth we know, and shatters verity's tooth:
  Hers, by your beauty, tempting her to stray,
  Thine, by your beauty, false, in disarray.

"
41,3,"The alluring sins of liberty sown,
When I'm aloof, they gather 'round your heart,
Your allure and wisdom, fittingly shown,
Temptation's grasp, with you, never dares depart.
Compassionate you are, and thus, to be treasured,
Beautiful you are, and thus, to be chased,
And when a spirit craves, no spirit measures,
Until it has, what it craves, it has embraced.
Oh, could you but cease, and recognize,
The pull of your grace, the attraction of youth,
That beckons us to the edge, amplifies
The truth we hold, and splinters verity's tooth:
  Hers, by your beauty, luring her untamed,
  Thine, by your beauty, false, unashamed."
42,1,"The fact you're hers does not encapsulate my sorrow,
Yet, I held her dear; such love was never shallow.
That she holds you, my heart's deepest lament,
A love-led parting, pain that's eloquently potent.

Offending lovers, I shall pardon you:
Your love for her stems from my love for true,
And she, in turn, for my sake suffers your reign,
Accepting my friend for my heart's own gain.

Were I to lose you, 'tis my love who'd gain,
And losing her, my friend would bear that pain;
Both unite, and I am left to endure,
This love-laden cross I must longingly cure.

In unity, my friend and I become as one,
Oh, sweet deception! She loves me, and none.

"
42,2,"It's not solely that she's yours which brings me strife,
But I did cherish her, through days and through life.
That she holds you close is the essence of my sighs,
A love-laden sorrow, in my heart it lies.

Dearest offenders, I shall grant you my grace:
You love her for my love's tender embrace,
And she, in turn, endures this wretched state,
For my sake, she accepts this love-filled trait.

Were she to depart, my loss would be her gain,
And losing you, my friend would bear the pain;
Both together, and I'm left in despair,
To suffer this love-heavy cross I must bear.

In harmony, my friend and I share a bond,
Oh, sweet illusion! She loves only me beyond.

"
42,3,"The knowledge of her choice does not wholly grieve,
Yet, I did love her deeply, emotions I can't weave.
That she chose you, my heart's most poignant ache,
A love-led wound, I cannot awake.

Offending cherishers, I shall absolve you hence:
You love her, for I loved first, such sweet coincidence,
And she, in turn, accepts this love-worn role,
For my sake, she adds to my heavy toll.

Were she to vanish, my loss would be her win,
And losing you, my friend would bear that sin;
Both embraced, and I am left alone,
To shoulder this love-ridden cross I've known.

In union, my friend and I share a soul,
Oh, sweet deception! She loves me, her only goal."
43,1,"When I mostly blink, my eyes perceive the best,
Throughout the day, they glimpse what often goes unnoticed;
But in my slumber, dreams of you are dressed,
And dimly radiant, they glow in the darkness covered.
Then you, whose shadow brightens every shade,
What joy it would bring to see your clearer light
In the bright day, when my unseeing gaze is laid
Upon the brilliance of your presence, pure and bright!
How blest would be my sight, beholding thee,
In daylit hours, when your true form shines,
While in the depth of night, your shadow falls on me,
A faint imprint on my sleep-filled mind.
  All days are dark till your true light appears,
  And nights are bright when you dispel my fears.

"
43,2,"My eyes see clear when I briefly close,
The day's distractions fade and lose their hold;
In dreams, my vision of you softly glows,
A beacon in the night, a tale to be told.
Your shadow casts a light on all it touches,
A gentle whisper in the day's bright blaze,
In sleep, your presence warms me, unapproached,
A fleeting glimpse of your eternal rays.
How I long to see you in the waking world,
Your true form shining in the light of day,
While in the night, your shadow is unfurled,
A tender touch that guides me on my way.
  All days are veiled in mist till you are near,
  And nights are bright when you dispel my fear.

"
43,3,"When I shut my lids, my vision is at its peak,
The world's distractions fade, and you come into sight,
In dreams, your presence whispers soft and meek,
A shimmering glow in the darkest night.
Your shadow dances, casting light on the ground,
A subtle presence in the day's bright glare,
In sleep, your essence gently surrounds,
A fleeting touch, a breath of tender air.
How I yearn to see you in the light of day,
Your true form radiant, in the sun's warm blaze,
While in the night, your shadow softly sways,
A gentle guide through the darkest maze.
  All days are shadows till you shine so bright,
  And nights are stars when you're in sight."
44,1,"Should my flesh's mass be but a thinking mind,
Vexing distance could never hinder me,
For mental bounds, once set, no chains can bind,
And swiftly to your side I'd swiftly flee.
No matter if my foot were on the farthest shore,
Or sunk within the ocean's deepest trench,
My nimble thoughts would soar to explore,
The space where it desires to reach.
Alas, I am not thought, but heavy matter,
Bound by time and space, I remain.
My heart, like water, grows fatter,
With longing for you, in vain.
Only left with tears, the wretched woe,
That binds me close, and slows my flow.

"
44,2,"Were my body but a vessel of pure thought,
Spiteful distance could not stay my course,
For thoughts, unbounded, would not be caught,
And swiftly find you at their source.
No matter if my foot were planted on foreign land,
Or sunk within the depths of sea's embrace,
My mind would understand, and take a stand,
At the place where it yearns to race.
But, alack, I am not thought, but flesh and bone,
Bound by time and space, I am undone.
My soul, like a river, all alone,
Cries out for you, under the sun.
Left with tears, the bitterest of woe,
That bind me here, in slow ebb and flow.

"
44,3,"If my corporeal self were but a thought,
Boundless distance could not stay my quest,
For thoughts, unleashed, would never be caught,
And swiftly find you, in your nest.
No matter if my foot were on the edge of earth,
Or sunk within the ocean's darkest hold,
My mind would know, and give me mirth,
At the place where it longs to behold.
But, ah, I am not thought, but flesh and blood,
Bound by time and space, I am in thrall.
My heart, like a captive, scarred and mudded,
Cries out for you, behind the wall.
Left with tears, the saddest of all woe,
That bind me here, in sorrow's flow."
45,1,"Two swift messengers, air and consuming flame,
In your presence, constant companions to me;
One, my intellect, the other, my soul's claim,
In subtle dance they weave, a harmony.
When fleeting thoughts and ardent longing part,
My spirit wanes, bereft, with sorrow filled,
A life of four reduced to but two parts,
Deprived of wholeness, strength and will diminished.
Yet, as your emissaries return with tales,
Of health and beauty, life rekindles, burns anew,
My joy restored, I celebrate your grace,
Only to plunge once more into despair.
For in their absence, solace fades away,
I bid them swiftly back, and darkness falls.

"
45,2,"Swift air and purifying fire, your touch,
In every corner of my world reside,
My thoughts and dreams, they roam as if too much,
Entwined in patterns by your hand implied.
Two fleeting guests, they dance upon my heart,
Their comings and goings, rhythm of my soul,
In your embrace, their flight begins, takes part,
My essence mingles with your healing role.
Alas, when they depart, my spirit sags,
Two of four reduced, a heavy toll to bear,
A life once vibrant, now with grief encumbered,
Despair and longing, shadows cast afar.
Yet, as they fly, returning swift and true,
My heart is mended, whole and bright and new.

"
45,3,"Two fleeting guests, the air and fiery core,
In every breath and longing, ever near,
My thoughts and heart's desire, forevermore,
In subtle dance, they draw me to you, my dear.
When swift-winged thoughts and ardor take their leave,
My soul, once full, is rent, with sorrow torn,
A life reduced, but two of four believe,
In your embrace, my heart, by love reborn.
But as your emissaries return once more,
Life's harmony resounds, a joyful song,
My heart, made whole, resumes its beat before,
Rejoicing in your love, so pure and strong.
And still, the cycle ebbs and flows, as they,
Depart and come, in endless play."
46,1,"A battle fierce within, my heart and sight,
Vie for mastery of your visage's charm.
My heart, it shields from view, your outer light,
While eyes usurp your inner spirit's calm.
My heart insists, within its chamber deep,
Your essence dwells, unseen by gazing eyes.
Yet my sight counters, in you it does keep
The beauty, which in its mirror lies.
A jury of thoughts, to this dispute summoned,
In heart's court, to this question lay their claim.
The verdict rendered, thus the judgment's dawned:
My eyes, your form; my heart, your inward flame.
  So thus: to eyes, your outer self is given,
  To heart, your love, in secret chambers, lives.

"
46,2,"My heart and eye, in discord, over thee,
Contend for right to claim thy visage fair.
My heart, thine inner self would captive be,
While my eye seeks to ensnare thy outer glare.
My heart doth plea, within its core, you're locked,
A fortress, veiled from my eye's probing sight.
Yet my eye, in rebuttal, mocks,
And asserts your beauty lies in light.
A trial held, in heart's high court convened,
With thoughts as jury, sworn to truth and right.
Their verdict spake, the case was thus amended:
My eye, your surface; heart, your hidden might.
  Thus: to my eye, your outward grace is granted,
  To heart, your secret love, forever's chanted.

"
46,3,"My heart and eye, in rift, dispute your grace,
Each striving to possess the full delight.
My heart, your secret self would embrace,
While my eye craves to bask in your pure light.
My heart implores, in its hidden place,
Your spirit dwells, unseen by gazing day.
Yet my eye contradicts, in its space,
Your beauty lies, it would have its way.
A judgment day, in heart's domain held,
With thoughts as arbiters, to truth's call sworn.
Their sentence passed, the battle's knell was tolled:
My eye, your outward guise; my heart, your scorn.
  So thus: to my eye, your surface is allotted,
  To heart, your secret love, forever's dotted."
47,1,"A distance lies 'twixt heart and gaze,
Yet mutual favors they exchange.
When longing seizes eye or heart's ache,
In love's image, solace they engage.
My heart, it feasts upon your portrait's feast,
And bids my eye partake in painted joy.
At other times, your thought is my heart's guest,
In love's embrace, it shares a rapturous alloy.
Thus, through your picture or my love's embrace,
You dwell with me, though far in distant lands.
For thought's domain transcends time and space,
And in my mind, you ever near stands.
  Or, if my thoughts slumber, in my sight,
  Your image stirs my heart to pure delight.

"
47,2,"A chasm spreads between my heart and sight,
Yet each bestows on other gentle grace.
When longing grips my heart or starved for light,
My love's sweet portrait fills the vacant space.
My heart, it dines upon the feast it sees,
And summons eye to share in love's delight.
At times, the eye becomes the heart's company,
In love's sweet thoughts, it revels through the night.
So, by your picture or my love's embrace,
You linger near, though distance keeps us far.
For thought's dominion knows no time nor place,
And in my mind, you're ever close at heart.
  Or, if my thoughts should rest in slumber's hold,
  Your image wakes my heart to love's sweet story untold.

"
47,3,"A gulf exists between my heart and gaze,
Yet both, in kind, bestow on other boons.
When longing seizes heart or sight in haze,
My love's sweet portrait shines like morning suns.
My heart, it banquets on the vision's feast,
And beckons eye to share in love's embrace.
At times, the eye becomes the heart's confidant,
In love's sweet thoughts, it revels face to face.
Thus, through your picture or my love's fond hold,
You dwell with me, though worlds apart we stand.
For thought's vast realm transcends the bounds of old,
And in my mind, you're ever by my hand.
  Or, if my thoughts should wander into sleep,
  Your image wakes my heart to love's eternal deep."
48,1,"With what caution I tread, each step I weigh,
Ensuring all trifles in trust I confine,
That they may remain unused, locked away,
Preserved from thieves in falsehood's dark design.

Yet, to you, my treasures are but trifles small,
My solace, my dearest, now my deepest sorrow,
You, the most precious, uncared for by all,
Are left exposed, vulnerable to the hollow.

I've kept you not in chests or strongboxes bound,
But close within my heart, where you truly dwell,
From which you may depart and then return,
In joy or pain, your presence I shall tell.

Still, I fear, even in my heart's embrace,
You'll be stolen, for true love breeds such a case.

"
48,2,"In wariness, I moved, securing all,
My trifles guarded by trust's firmest bars,
That they might lie in wait, unused to fall,
From reach of falsehood, safe in vaults of hearts.

But you, the jewel of my soul's delight,
My dearest, truest, now my heaviest care,
Have been left open, exposed to base sight,
A prize for every thief in the world to snare.

No chest nor lockbox held you in its hold,
Save in the tender fortress of my breast,
From whence you come and go, as you have told,
Yet, there I fear, you'll be stolen, put to test.

For truth itself doth pilfer gems so rare,
In love's own game, where hearts play hard to share.

"
48,3,"With utmost care, I chose my path that day,
Ensuring trifles found their trusty bars,
That they might lie in wait, unused, at bay,
From falsehood's grasp, concealed in truth's own vaults.

Yet, you, my truest treasure, now my grief,
My dearest, most precious, left unguarded,
Have been made prey to the unworthy thief,
A gemstone scorned by the world, unvaried.

I kept you not in chests or strongboxes bound,
But locked away within my heart's own hold,
From whence you'd leave and then return, unbound,
In joy or sorrow, your presence, my tale told.

Still, I fear, even in my heart's embrace,
You'll be stolen, for true love plays such a chase."
49,1,"In anticipation, should that moment arise,
When you look upon my flaws with disfavor,
When your affection has reached its ultimate prize,
Compelled by respect to settle the score;
When you'll walk past me, barely offering a smile,
As love transforms into a solemn duty;
I take shelter in self-awareness all the while,
Arming myself with reason and propriety.
I stand firm, within the fortress of my worth,
Defending the legitimacy of your choice,
For you possess the might to leave me bereft,
And I cannot argue for a love-based voice.
  To part from me, you've the power of decree,
  I cannot contest, for I see the decree's legitimacy.

"
49,2,"Should the hour arrive when you regard me amiss,
When your affection has reached its zenith,
When respect commands that you count the cost,
And love turns to gravity, devoid of its lith;
I retreat to the fortress of my self-esteem,
Raising my hand in defense of your wisdom,
Aware of the strength in your every theme,
Accepting the verdict of your judgment.
You have the right to abandon my side,
Based on the strength of your convictions,
I can offer no argument, only abide,
By the rules of your heart's dictations.
  To leave me, you have the power of command,
  I can but understand, and release my claim on your hand.

"
49,3,"Prepared for the instant when you from me withdraw,
When your love has reached its fullest measure,
When respect demands a reckoning of all I saw,
And love turns cold, a creature of austere pleasure;
I entrench myself in the knowledge of my worth,
Arming myself with reasons for your choice,
Defending the legitimacy of your every claim,
Accepting the verdict of your voice.
You have the might to leave me alone,
Based on the strength of your own,
I can offer no counter, only atone,
By the rules of your heart, a loan.
  To part from me, you have the power to choose,
  I can but accede, for I see the truth in your views."
50,1,"What weight does my journey bear, I pray,
As I near the end of this wearying road,
Finding rest in the thought of one who'll stay,
A friend, from whom these miles have e'er flowed?
The steed beneath me, burdened by my sorrow,
Moves slowly, bearing the weight of my heart,
As if it knows, by some hidden morrow,
That I, its rider, seek a distant start.
The sharpest spur cannot force it to speed,
For anger's thrust brings forth but a groan,
A sound that echoes in my heart's deep,
A reminder of the joy I've left alone.
  For in this sound, I find my heart's plight:
  My joy recedes, my grief moves on in light.

"
50,2,"How heavy is this road I traverse, I muse,
When all I long for is my journey's close,
A haven taught by one who gives me peace,
A friend, from whom these miles of strife arose.
The creature that carries me, worn by my care,
Trudges on, bearing the weight of my soul,
As if it knows, by some hidden affair,
That I, its master, seek a distant goal.
The fiercest prod cannot make it run fast,
For rage's sting only brings forth a sigh,
A sound that pierces through my heart's vast,
A whisper of the joy I left up high.
  For in this sigh, I find my heart's truth:
  My joy retreats, my grief chases after.

"
50,3,"How heavy lies my path, I ponder and sigh,
As I draw nigh to the end of this hard course,
Finding solace in the thought of one so kind,
A friend, from whom these miles have e'er been forced.
The beast beneath me, weary from my woe,
Lumbers along, bearing the weight of my strife,
As if it knows, by some hidden woe,
That I, its rider, seek a distant life.
The sharpest rowel cannot urge it ahead,
For fury's touch brings forth but a groan,
A sound that haunts me, heavy as lead,
A reminder of the joy I left alone.
  For in this groan, I find my heart's tale:
  My joy recedes, my grief pursues the trail."
51,1,"Thus may my affection pardon the delay
Of my slow messenger, as I depart:
Why rush from your side, when I've found my way?
No haste is needed, staying close to your heart.
What reason can my humble steed provide
When urgency seems sluggish in its pace?
I'd urge him on, yet still he'd not decide,
For in his stead, the wind would win the race.
No horse could match my longing's fervent pace;
Thus, perfected love shall swiftly make its claim,
With fire and spirit, it will win the chase.
Love for love's sake shall my stead's delay redeem:
  ""Though parting from you, he lingered on the path,
  My love runs swiftly towards you, setting him free.""

"
51,2,"Thus, love allows my steed's delay to pass
When I must leave your side, so dear;
From where you are, why should I hurry past?
Till I return, no haste could ever steer.
What reason will my patient mount provide
When urgency seems slow in its advance?
Then should I press, though mounted on the tide;
In swift currents, no motion feels a chance.
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
Thus, perfected affection grants me grace,
And love's own wings shall carry me apace.
Love for love's sake shall excuse my steed's grace:
  ""Since from you going, he moved with gentle care,
  My love shall hasten, granting him reprieve.""

"
51,3,"Thus, love permits my steed's unhurried gait
When I depart from where you dwell;
Why hasten from your side, when I find my fate?
No need for haste, as your love does compel.
What reason will my gentle mount provide
When urgency seems slow in its course?
Then should I press, though borne on the moon's tide;
In lunar glow, no motion feels remorse.
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
Thus, perfected love shall grant me space,
And love's own wings shall lift me from my place.
Love for love's sake shall excuse my mount's grace:
  ""Since from you parting, he moved with gentle ease,
  My love shall hasten, granting him release."""
52,1,"Much as the wealthy cherish their hidden wealth,
Secure in vaults, untouched, of inestimable worth,
Withholding frequent gaze to preserve pristine stealth,
Savoring rare glimpses of unmatched pearls on earth.

Feasts are thus prepared with great consideration,
Infrequent and treasured in the passage of time,
Precious as gems in calculated distribution,
Or rare pearls adorning the royal diadem's rhyme.

You, my treasure, lie within my outstretched arms,
Hidden as garments in the wardrobe awaiting use,
Awaiting moments of revelation, causing no alarms,
Newly unfurled, your beauty to produce.

Blessed are you, your presence brings delight,
Awaited in absence, cherished in sight.

"
52,2,"Like the rich, guarding their unseen riches,
Preserved in vaults, admired but not worn,
To keep their value and allure unblemished,
Their worth in secrecy forever sworn.

Hence, feasts become events of great significance,
Rare and cherished, like stars in the night,
Or gemstones, carefully placed in brilliance,
Adorning the necklaces of kings in light.

You, my precious one, are kept close to heart,
Hidden as treasures in the stronghold of love,
Revealed in moments, setting apart,
Newly discovered, as from heavens above.

Blessed are you, your worth is ever known,
In presence, a solace, in absence, a throne.

"
52,3,"Rich as those possessing hidden wealth untold,
In strongboxes, guarded, gleaming untouched,
Withholding their beauty, to keep it whole,
Reveling in rare glimpses, as hearts are crushed.

So feasts become occasions of great moment,
Scarce and treasured, like jewels in a crown,
Or pearls, strung carefully, prominent,
Adorning the necks of queens in renown.

You, my precious hoard, are kept near and dear,
Hidden as secrets in the heart's deepest core,
Revealed in whispers, setting ear to ear,
Newly discovered, as never before.

Blessed are you, your worth is ever praised,
In presence, your brilliance never fades."
53,1,"Of what are you composed, that so many forms
Find refuge in your essence, taking shade?
Each soul, a single shade, yet you pervade
A myriad of shadows, generously laid.

Adonis, in his prime, pales next to thee,
A flawed reflection of your timeless grace.
Upon fair Helen's visage, art may be
Applied, but you outshine in Grecian lace.

Speak of the earth's rebirth, the verdant bloom,
It but reflects your splendor, nothing more.
And in your boundless gifts, hope finds a room,
As every shape we cherish, bears your core.

In every lovely grace, you have a hand,
Yet none can claim to hold, a heart so grand.

"
53,2,"What is your essence, from which shadows spring,
A multitude of forms upon you cast?
Each person bears a single shade, a thing
That you, in all your singularity, surpassed.

In every counterfeit of Adonis found,
Your virtue shines through, the truest form.
Upon fair Helen's cheek, in beauty bound,
Your visage breaks, no longer dormant.

Speak of the year's richness, and the spring,
Their beauty but a shadow, gracefully.
Your bounty, too, in every lovely thing,
Revealed, as if to set the captive free.

In every blessed shape, your presence gleams,
Yet none can claim to hold, a heart it seems.

"
53,3,"What constitutes your being, to which shadows cling,
In myriad forms upon your spirit laid?
Each soul, a solitary shade, does bring
A tribute to your boundless, unmatched cascade.

In every imitation of Adonis' grace,
Your archetype prevails, the purest form.
Upon fair Helen, art may find a place,
Yet, you emerge, in Grecian beauty warm.

Speak of the earth's renewal, verdant hue,
It but reflects your splendor, infinite.
And in your gifts, hope's seedling finds its cue,
As every lovely form, your essence animate.

In every gracious shape, your essence thrives,
Yet none can claim to hold, a heart that strives."
54,1,"Oh, how beauty's allure is more when graced
With truth's sweet charm, enhancing beauty's bloom.
The rose's grace, in light of this, is chased
To heights sublime, in its sweet scent it looms.
The blemished flowers may share the rose's hue,
Yet lack the scent that gives the rose its worth.
To thorny branches they are closely true,
Their fleeting beauty fails to gain earth's girth.
Yet perfect roses, in their sweet demise,
Bestow their fragrance on the open air.
In verse, your truth distilled in sweet goodbyes,
Lives on, immortal, as your star does flare.
   So too, fair youth, your beauty's transient hour
   Shall find its echo in poetic power.

"
54,2,"Behold, how beauty's visage brightly gleams
When truth does lend its charm, increasing grace.
The rose's form, when bathed in truth, it seems
More lovely still, its sweet perfume to trace.
The canker's bloom may match the rose's shade,
But scent alone sets roses worlds apart.
Upon the thorns, these blossoms are displayed,
Their fleeting beauty wounds the stony heart.
The true rose's fragrant soul, on deathbed laid,
Bestows its sweetness on the breeze it rides.
In verse, your truth distilled, your memory's aid,
Lives on, a testament to love that guides.
   Thus, lovely youth, your beauty's fleeting time
   Shall echo on in verse, transcending time.

"
54,3,"In truth, beauty's visage shines more bright
When truth does grace it, adding to its allure.
The rose's form, when bathed in truth's soft light,
Gains lustre, as its sweet scent doth ensnare.
The canker's bloom may share the rose's glow,
But scent alone sets roses far above.
On thorny stems, these blossoms come and go,
Their fleeting beauty touches few who probe.
The true rose's fragrant heart, as it does fade,
Bestows its sweetness on the winds that roam.
In verse, your truth distilled, your essence made,
Lives on, a beacon calling those who roam.
   So, beauteous youth, your fleeting loveliness
   Shall find its voice in verse, your truth's caress."
55,1,"No of marble, nor gilded royal tombs
Shall endure past this potent verse's span,
But you, within these lines, shall find your bloom
And outshine stone by Time's uncleaned hand.
When war's destruction topples statues tall,
And conflict's rage undoes the mason's craft,
No sword of Mars nor fire of strife shall maul
The living testament of your afterlife.
Unyielding, you shall stride past death and hate,
In every age your glory shall be sung,
Persisting through the centuries' endless wait,
A living song within each heart that's young.
  Until the day when you, in glory, rise,
  You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

"
55,2,"Not with marble nor with gilded lords' shrines
Shall these strong lines find rivalry in time,
But you shall brightly gleam in written designs
More than the filth of Time on unkempt stone.
When war's chaotic storms bring statues low,
And strife consumes the craft of stonemasonry,
Nor Mars' sharp sword nor war's swift flame shall know
To sear the vital record of your story.
Against the foe that brings oblivion near,
Your triumphant fame shall find a way,
In every age, enduring through the tear,
Of time, remaining in the light of day.
  Until the hour when you, in splendor, rise,
  You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

"
55,3,"Neither with marble nor with gilded kings' tombs
Shall this fierce verse discover equal fate,
But you shall thrive and gleam in written rooms
Beyond the reach of Time's uncleanly slate.
When war's tumultuous rage brings statues down,
And strife consumes the mason's artful might,
Nor Mars' fierce sword nor war's consuming crown
Shall touch the beating heart of your delight.
Against the tide of death and hateful spite,
Your everlasting praise shall carve a place,
A living tale that shines in endless light,
Through time, preserving your unmatched grace.
  Until the moment when you, in glory, rise,
  You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes."
56,1,"Dearest love, rekindle your vigor anew,
Lest it be said your ardor wanes too fast,
Sated today, but tomorrow's zest
Outshines today's, as the tide outlasts.
So let your love be ever-changing, sated now
Only to crave again, as sun gives way to moon,
In constant ebb and flow, waxing and waning, how
The tides of love remain forever in tune.
Like the seasons' change, as winter's care
Gives way to summer's bloom, so too, may love
Be born anew, more cherished and more rare.
Or name it hope, that springs from depths of glove,
  For love, like seasons, ebbs and flows, and thrives
  In constant change, and thus, forever lives.

"
56,2,"Sweet love, recharge thy spirit, let it not
Appear less keen than hunger's ravenous call,
Which sated by the day, returns once more
With sharpened appetite, its strength installed.
So let your love be ever-renewing, fed
By fleeting moments, as the sun gives light,
Tomorrow holds the promise of its bed,
Awakening love, from slumber's dulling night.
Let this space in between, like autumn's leave,
That drifts between the colors of the year,
Be but a pause, a breath, a moment's reprieve,
Awaiting love's return, and joy to bear.
  Or call it hope, that thrives in winter's care,
  And blooms in springtime's warmth, and summer's air.

"
56,3,"Dearest love, rekindle now your fire,
Lest it be thought your passion fades too fast,
Sated by day, but sharpened by the night,
A cycle ever-changing, as love's past.
So let your love be ever-shifting, fed
By fleeting instances, as stars give way,
Tomorrow holds the promise of its bed,
Awakening love, from slumber's dulling sway.
Let this space in between, like twilight's hue,
That lingers between the day and night,
Be but a pause, a breath, a moment true,
Awaiting love's return, and stars' bright light.
  Or call it hope, that thrives in darkness' care,
  And shines in light of day, and moonlit air."
57,1,"In service to you, how else should I act
But mark the moments of your heart's content?
No moments of mine left unaccounted for,
Nor deeds to offer till your wishes are spent.
I'll not reproach the ceaseless march of time,
While watching over the clock for your sake,
Nor find the taste of solitude a crime,
When you, my liege, have taken your leave.
I'll not let envy taint my thoughts of where
You wander or the tasks in which you're engaged,
But, like a mournful servant, dwell in air
Where memories of your joy are fully caged.
  So deep a devotee is love, it sees
  No wrong in you, though you may stray with ease.

"
57,2,"Bound to your side, what choice have I but wait
And heed the rhythm of your deepest needs?
My time is not my own, but yours to dictate,
My actions merely echoes of your deeds.
I cannot frown upon the endless flow
Of hours, while vigilant for your return,
Nor find the sting of loneliness to grow
When you command my absence to discern.
No room for doubt or questioning remains,
As to your whereabouts or what you do,
For I, your loyal subject, shall remain
And ponder on the bliss your presence imbues.
  Such pure a worshipper is love, it grants
  You freedom, yet still adores your bounds.

"
57,3,"Devoted to your cause, what else can I do
But track the tides of your unwavering wish?
My time and tasks are bound to serve anew,
My purpose but to grant your heart's sole wish.
I'll not rebuke the steady march of time,
While keeping watch for your arrival's call,
Nor find the taste of solitude a crime,
When you, my master, bid me stand tall.
Unyielding to the whispers of mistrust,
I'll not inquire where you may wander or roam,
For I, your faithful servant, shall adjust
My world to orbit wherever you comb.
  So steadfast a follower is love, it bends
  To every whim, each twist and turn it lends."
58,1,"He who decreed, once made me subject to thee,
I ought not in mind, manage thy delight's hour,
Nor at thy touch, petition for moments' decree,
Ensnared as I am, in thine every dower.
Grant me the strength, to bear thy whimsical lead,
The captive's absence in thy liberty's cell,
With forbearance, I'll endure, each pause and thread,
Without reproach, thy freedom I'd never quell.
Roam where thou desireth, thy right so immense,
That thou thyself, may grant thine hours' own reign,
In thine hands, lies pardon, from transgression's sense,
By my will, I'm bound, to suffer no complaint.
  I'll wait, though torment, be the companion of waiting,
  Not fault thy pleasure, whatever its dictating.

"
58,2,"The powers, that shaped me, your devoted thrall,
I must not dare, to question thy leisure's span,
Nor at thy side, plead for the reckoning of all,
Bound to serve, at thy command and plan.
Oh, let me endure, the pangs of waiting game,
The captive's distance, in your liberty's cage,
With restraint, I'll face, each halt and claim,
Without resentment, your freedom's every gauge.
Wander where thou wishest, thy rule so vast,
That thou mayest choose, thy time's own domain,
In thine authority, resides absolution's past,
By my choice, I'm fettered, to bear thy disdain.
  I'm doomed to bide, while hope and anguish, both abide,
  Not judge thy pleasure, be it right or misguided.

"
58,3,"The forces, that cast me, in your servile role,
I ought not dream, to rule thy joy's allotted share,
Nor at thy call, request the tally of control,
Ensnared in thine embrace, I am thy debtor, aware.
Give me the fortitude, to face thy fleeting will,
The captive's solitude, in liberty's own fort,
With forbearance, I'll abide, each ebb and swell,
Without reproach, thy freedom's shifting sort.
Roam at thy pleasure, thy space so wide,
That thou thyself, may grant time's own boon,
In thine own hand, lies pardon, far and wide,
By my decision, I'm confined, to accept thy boon.
  I must await, though torment, be the only mate,
  Not find fault in thy pleasure, come what may or fate."
59,1,"If innovation is but what once was,
And thoughts we seek are but rehashed ideals,
How taxing for the mind, in tireless cause,
To labor, birth new ideas, and reveal
The weight of wisdom from the past once more,
A burden heavy on the shoulders' bend.
If ancient texts could open up their door,
Reveal five centuries of tales unend,
Might I within their pages find your face,
A timeless beauty, etched in history?
Would we appear improved, or they efface
Our progress, trapped in stagnant mystery?
In certainty, I'd wager, wiser heads
Praised lesser subjects in their ancient threads.

"
59,2,"In this realm where naught is truly new,
Only reused, refashioned from the old,
Our minds, bewitched, create anew
The patterns worn by time untold.
Oh, to peruse a chronicle of yore,
A record spanning suns innumerable,
To glimpse your form in tales of lore,
The first imprint of your inimitable fable.
Might I discern the musings of the past,
Alike or different, in your visage cast?
Are we the better, or are they the last,
In this eternal cycle, ever to outlast?
I'll stake my claim, the ancients' minds,
In praise of lesser things, left humankind.

"
59,3,"If every thought's but a revisited past,
And innovation's but a fleeting ghost,
How heavy lies the laborer's task at last,
To summon thoughts that others may have boasted.
If records could, with backward glance, unfurl
The tapestry of centuries long stitched,
Reveal five hundred cycles of the sun's whirl,
Might I discover your familiar visage sketched?
In ancient annals, could I trace your grace,
The first imprint of your form's embrace?
Would we find revolution's steady pace,
Or progress lost in time's unending chase?
I'd wager, yes, the ancients' wiser minds,
In praise of lesser things, they left us kind."
60,1,"As waves rush to the pebbled beach, so too
Our fleeting moments speed towards their close;
Each taking turns with those that came anew,
In ceaseless struggle, all in unison go.
Born in brilliance, crawling to maturity,
Facing eclipses fighting against its light,
Time bestows a gift, then turns it to decay,
And what it once gave, it now destroys outright.
Time etches lines on faces, once so smooth,
Tracing wrinkles where there once was none,
Feeding on the wonders of Nature's bloom,
Leaving naught but barren plains where life had run.
Yet, in the face of Time's relentless sweep,
My verse will stand, your worth in verses keep.

"
60,2,"Waves relentlessly advance to the shore,
Minutes hasten to their inevitable end,
Alternating places, as was before,
In ceaseless pursuit, together they contend.
Emerging in the dawn of purest light,
Slowly maturing, crowned with radiance grand,
Yet shadows fall, obstructing brightness' flight,
Time's gift, once cherished, now it disavows.
Time etches lines on faces, once so fair,
Sculpts furrows deep in beauty's visage,
Feeds on the gems of Nature's bounty rare,
And leaves behind but echoes of its age.
But still, amidst Time's cruel, endless sweep,
My verse will stand, your worth in verses seep.

"
60,3,"Waves dance towards the stony, wave-worn shore,
Our days advance, in haste, to their demise,
Each trading places, as was evermore,
In ceaseless motion, all together rise.
Birthed in the dawn of purest light,
Slowly maturing, crowned with wisdom's grace,
Yet shadows fall, obscuring radiance bright,
Time's gift, once treasured, now it does erase.
Time carves lines on faces, once so bright,
Traces furrows deep in beauty's brow,
Feeds on the jewels of Nature's pure delight,
Leaves naught but memories where life did grow.
Yet, in the face of Time's relentless flow,
My verse will stand, your worth in verses show."
61,1,"Do you wish for your likeness to hold sway,
My heavy lids in the tired night ajar?
Is it your longing that my sleep should fray
As shadows dance, mimicking you from afar?
Is it your essence that you send abroad,
In quest of mine inmost secrets to glean,
To lay bare my faults and idle hours' fraud,
The breadth and depth of your suspicion's sheen?
Nay, 'tis not love, though plentiful in you,
That rouses me from slumber's sweet embrace.
My own heart's love, so ardent and so true,
Denies me rest, each idle moment chased.
  For you I watch while you in dreams are drowned,
  In distant lands, with others all around.

"
61,2,"Dare you command your image to bestow
Upon my heavy eyelids wakeful power?
Do you request my dreams should come and go
While phantom shadows mimic you each hour?
Is it your soul that you dispatch to spy,
To sift through mine in search of hidden vice,
To measure faults and idle hours' false guise,
The width and depth of your jealousy's price?
No, 'tis not love, though deep within you lies,
That stirs my heart from sleep's sweet, gentle hold.
My own true love, unsleeping, meets your eyes,
A steadfast watchman guarding night from old.
  For you I stand while you in dreams are bound,
  In distant lands, with others all around.

"
61,3,"Can it be your wish that your visage grants
The strength to rouse my heavy eyelids' night?
Do you require my dreams to ebb and flow
As shadows dance, as you in darkness might?
Is it your essence that you bid me view,
To scrutinize my heart in search of flaws,
To seek out shames and moments misspent, true,
The sum and total of your jealousy's cause?
Nay, 'tis not love, though vast within you swells,
That rouses me from dreams' embrace so kind.
My own true love, so fervent, never fells,
A steadfast guard, for you, it stays behind.
  For you I watch while you in dreams are lost,
  In distant lands, with others all around."
62,1,"The transgression of self-admiration, it holds
My gaze and heart in its unyielding grip;
No atonement can this sin of mine behold,
So deeply rooted is its false tripping dip.

In my sight, no countenance so fair as mine,
No figure true, no wisdom quite so grand;
I, in my self-delusion, do enshrine
My worth above all others, in every land.

Yet, when the mirror shows the truth untold,
An aged visage, weathered by time's cruel hand,
My self-love twists to its own counterfold,
A sinner, loving self, in deceitful land.

For thee, I paint my age with days of youth,
In self-delusion, seeking eternal truth.

"
62,2,"This guilt of self-regard, it captures me,
Ensnared within its snare of inward gaze;
No penance serves to cleanse this impurity,
Entwined with ego, lost in self-made maze.

To me, no visage shines as bright as mine,
No form so perfect, none holds such grace;
I, in my arrogance, do thus confine
My value to surpass all others' place.

But when the glass reveals the lines of age,
A battle-worn warrior, worn by strife,
My self-love falters on its own stage,
A villain, loving self, in chaotic life.

In reverence of self, I paint my age,
In self-delusion, seeking life's own gauge.

"
62,3,"The fault of self-adoration, it enthralls,
My senses captive to its alluring song;
No absolution can this sin forestall,
So deeply fixed, it has grown ever strong.

In my perspective, none so comely as I,
No figure true, no wisdom quite so bright;
I, in my self-infatuation, do tie
My worth to eclipse all others in my sight.

Yet, when the glass exposes age's mark,
A faded portrait, tarnished by the years,
My self-love wavers in its own stark,
A traitor, loving self, in darkened mirrors.

For thee, I paint my age with colors new,
In self-delusion, seeking beauty true."
63,1,"In defiance of love, Time's cruelty looms,
Aged and worn, I'll stand against its toll;
When hours have bled his vibrant bloom,
And furrows plow deep lines upon his soul.
Yet, in the dawn of life's first light,
He reigns as king o'er charms that fade;
Those jewels of youth, precious and bright,
By Time's cruel hand, are being raided.
So, I arm myself against advancing years,
To keep love's image ever near;
Preserving beauty through tears,
A monument to what I hold dear.
  In these dark lines, his visage gleams,
  And evermore, his youthful dreams.

"
63,2,"Confronting love, I steel myself against
The ravages of Time's relentless chase;
As hours pass, his strength is spent,
And age's cruel hand etches its embrace.
Gone the radiant bloom of morning's grace,
Replaced by furrows deep and lines that score;
Yet, memories of love's sweet embrace,
Shall I forevermore in black and white adore.
A fortress built against encroaching years,
To house the beauty of my lover's prime,
Preserved through tears and endless fears,
An eternal monument in verse, sublime.
  In these lines, love's portrait thrives,
  And through them, he forever lives.

"
63,3,"Bracing for love's battle with Time's cruel scythe,
I stand steadfast as the years advance;
With every fleeting moment, life's vigor takes flight,
And age's harsh hand etches its trace.
Gone the morning of his youthful days,
Replaced by furrows deep and lines of age;
Yet, in these verses, love's beauty stays,
An eternal spring, forever on the page.
A fortress raised against the march of years,
To guard the treasure of his springtime charms;
In black and white, love conquers fears,
An everlasting monument, love disarms.
  In these words, his visage gleams,
  And through them, his youthful dreams."
64,1,"As Time's harsh hand erodes away grandeur,
Defacing wealth of past generations,
I see the fall of lofty towers, certain doom
Of once-proud structures, slaves to human passions.
Witnessing the ocean's ravenous advance,
Its encroachment on the land's dominion,
And solid earth relinquishing its stance,
Yielding to water's ruthless invasion;
In this exchange of power, I contemplate
The fragile state of all that I adore,
As Time's relentless march may alter fate,
And what I cherish slips away forevermore.
A morose reflection, yet I cannot help
But grieve for what I fear to lose itself.

"
64,2,"When Time's unyielding grip disfigures
The opulent remnants of a bygone era,
I watch as lofty towers crumble,
Victims of humanity's capricious fury.
Beholding as the ocean savagely feeds
Upon the land, swallowing its terrain,
And the resolute earth, in defeat, concedes
Its ground to the ceaseless, salty rain;
In this reshaping of the world, I ponder
The ephemeral nature of my affection,
For Time's indifferent progression may plunder
My heart's treasures, leaving naught but desolation.
With somber wisdom, I accept this truth,
That Time will steal what I hold dear in youth.

"
64,3,"In the presence of Time's remorseless grasp,
That ravages the splendor of the old,
I observe the fall of lofty towers,
Their once-proud stature now by decay enfold.
Witness to the ocean's insatiable quest,
As it encroaches on the realm of sand,
And solid ground, succumbing to water's test,
Relinquishes its claim to dry expanse;
In this continual cycle of ascent and fall,
I meditate on love's own fleeting season,
For Time's relentless pursuit may enthrall
My heart's deepest longings, leaving naught but treason.
With heavy heart, I grasp this solemn fact,
That Time will steal the love I cannot lack."
65,1,"Than brass, or stone, or earthen depths, or tide,
Mortality's dominion does not cease.
How then might beauty's gentle supplication abide,
When its influence wields no more force than a bloom's increase?
How can summer's sweetest breath endure
In the face of onslaught from the battering storm?
Even rock, steadfast and secure,
And gates of iron, strong and warm,
Do crumble and give way to Time's assault,
Lost to the ravages of days, of form and thought.

Alas, what refuge for the gems Time hoards?
What force can halt his remorseless stride?
Can hands, however strong, his march withstand,
Or turn away the tide of beauty's end?

Nay, none but this: that in the written word,
My love's bright light may yet be heard.

"
65,2,"Brass, stone, earth, and sea, all subject to
The fleeting grasp of mortal coil.
How, then, might beauty' distinct from me
Assert its claim amidst this turmoil?
Summer's honeyed breath, so soft and warm,
Can it prevail against the siege of days?
No fortress, however firm, can confirm
Its strength against the ravages of Time's gaze.

Fearful contemplation! Where, in sadness,
Does Time's most precious treasure dwell?
Can hands, though strong, his swift advance halt,
Or turn away the spoil of beauty's knell?

None, save this miracle: that blackest ink
May hold my love, and keep its brilliance linked.

"
65,3,"Brass, stone, earth, and sea, all subject to
The whims of mortal life's decay.
How, then, might beauty plead its suit,
Its strength no greater than a wilted spray?
Can honeyed summer breath endure
Against the storm's relentless, wrackful siege?
Even rock, steadfast and secure,
Cannot withstand the grinding of Time's teeth.

Alack, what fortress can withstand
The march of Time, so fierce and grand?
Can hands, however strong, his stride arrest,
Or turn away the spoil of beauty's crest?

None, but this hope: that blackest ink
May hold my love, and keep its brilliance linked."
66,1,"Longing for respite from life's cruel jest,
I yearn for rest, like death's own gentle guest:
A desert-born begger, clothed in mirth,
In poverty and joy, a curious birth;
Unwavering faith, now faithlessly forsook,
Golden honor, tarnished and amiss,
Innocence defiled, its virtue lost,
And strength now hobbled, power rendered lame,
Art shackled, silenced by the powers that be,
Folly donning wisdom's cloak with ease,
Truth labeled simple, twisted and misused,
Goodness held captive, serving villainy.
  Away from all this, I'd flee, but stay—
  For love alone keeps death's cold hand at bay.

"
66,2,"Seeking solace, I, for weary death, do call:
As arid deserts birth a pauper king,
Joy donned by need, a strange carnival,
Unblemished faith, by fate unstrung,
Gilded honor, sold for dross,
Virtue stained, its maidenhead lost,
Perfection marred, unjustly scorned,
Strength hobbled, power overthrown,
Art gagged, by rule and rote confined,
Folly cloaked in wisdom's guise,
Simple truth, maligned, misaligned,
Captive good, in evil's thrall entwined.
  From these, I'd flee, but here I'll bide,
  For love keeps fast my wayward heart and tide.

"
66,3,"Weary of life, I cry out for the quiet sleep of death:
As deserts birth a mendicant in finery,
Joy adorning need, a peculiar display,
Faith once steadfast, now forsworn in deceit,
Gilded honor, sold for baser metal,
Innocence defiled, its virtue shed,
Perfection wronged, reviled and cast aside,
Strength hobbled, power usurped,
Art silenced, bound by tyranny,
Folly in wisdom's guise, reigning,
Truth, once simple, now maligned,
Captive good, in service to the wicked.
  From these, I long to take my leave,
  Yet love alone my heart from death does cleave."
67,1,"How comes it that he dwells in unwellness,
Enhancing with his being impious ways,
That sin may find an advantage, impress
His company upon its dark displays?
Why should false colors mimic his own face,
Steal life's true essence from its rightful place?
Why should false beauty borrow from his grace,
Seeking shadows where no roses bloom and brace?
Why does he linger, when the world's turned cold,
Drained of the blood that once ran warm and bright?
For Nature's treasure now is but a hoard,
Depleted, spent in her eternal fight.
  In him she keeps her ancient wealth displayed,
  A testament to days of yore, long laid.

"
67,2,"What purpose drives him to live in such plight,
Where sin and shame find comfort in his wake?
Why does false color borrow from his light,
Seeking to ape his visage's vibrant make?
Why should poor beauty borrow from his hue,
When his own bloom is genuine and true?
Why should he live, when all the world is new,
Its veins once full of life, now drained and through?
For Nature's self is now but poor and bare,
Bankrupt of blood to blush through lively veins,
And he, so rich, has wealth to spare,
A living testament to life's remains.
  In him she sees her ancient wealth displayed,
  A tribute to the days when life was made.

"
67,3,"How can it be that he exists thus,
Infected by the sin that he allows?
Why should false faces borrow from his blush,
Stealing the life that once was his alone?
Why should poor beauty seek to counterfeit
His natural grace, his beauty so replete?
Why should he live, when all the world is bleak,
Its veins once full of life, now drained and weak?
For Nature's self is now but cold and dead,
Bankrupt of blood to blush through lively veins,
And he, so rich, has wealth to shed,
A living testament to life's remains.
  In him she sees her ancient wealth displayed,
  A tribute to the days when life was made."
68,1,"Thus, his visage bears the tale of days long past,
When beauty bloomed and faded like the flowers do now,
Before these modern signs of grace were cast,
Or dared to settle on a living brow.
Before the sun-kissed locks of the deceased,
The right of graves, were stolen away
To find a second life on another's head,
Ere beauty's lifeless strands adorned another's play.
In him, those sacred ancient hours reside,
Unadorned, genuine, in solitude,
Granting no summer to another's pride,
Stealing no past to grace his beauty anew.
  And him, Nature keeps as a timeless guide,
  To reveal false art the beauty that once did stride.

"
68,2,"Thus, his face holds the memory of days long spent,
When beauty danced and left as fleeting as the winds.
Before these false masks of charm were lent,
Or dared to claim a place on faces unconfined.
Before the radiant tresses of the silent sleepers,
The right of tombs, were plucked away
To find a second life on another's wreath,
Ere beauty's lost locks adorned another's display.
In him, those hallowed ancient moments dwell,
Unornamented, pure, in seclusion,
Granting no summer to another's swell,
Stealing no yesterdays to ornament his beauty's fruition.
  And him, Nature keeps as a sacred scroll,
  To teach false art the beauty that once was whole.

"
68,3,"Thus, his mien displays the chronicle of days long gone,
When beauty dazzled and faded like the dawn.
Before these shallow symbols of grace were drawn,
Or dared to rest upon a living fawn.
Before the resplendent locks of the silent slumberers,
The right of crypts, were shorn away
To find a second life on another's stage,
Ere beauty's fallen tresses adorned another's array.
In him, those revered ancient instants abide,
Unadorned, authentic, in isolation,
Granting no summer to another's pride,
Stealing no yesterdays to embellish his beauty's foundation.
  And him, Nature stores as a timeless blueprint,
  To unveil false art the beauty that once was a triumph."
69,1,"The visible aspects of your being,
Graced by the world's admiring gaze,
Desire no improvement, for they are free
From blemish, as the heart's thoughts raise.

All tongues, the soul's expression, grant
The praise you rightly deserve,
In truth they speak, and foes relent
To laud what once they did not serve.

Your outward shines with accolades,
But those same voices, in discord,
Confuse the praise they once conveyed,
By seeking depths beyond the surface explored.

They glimpse the radiance of your mind,
And judge its worth by deeds they find,
Yet, lacking grace, their praise is marred,
A fragrant bloom with foul scent paired.

But why does your essence not align
With the appearance you display in full?
The reason lies in where you choose to shine,
For common ground obscures your true allure.

"
69,2,"The facets of you seen by all,
Lack not for praise that mends the heart.
All tongues, the soul's unhidden call,
Bestow the honor that you start.

Your outward shines with words of cheer,
Yet those same voices, in their art,
Confuse the praises they once held near,
By seeking wisdom in your heart.

They see the beauty in your thought,
And measure it by actions wrought,
Then, blindly, they misconstrue,
Their praise for you, distorted and askew.

But why your essence does not suit,
The image you in public put,
The reason lies within your roots,
For common ground obscures your bloom's pursuit.

"
69,3,"The aspects shown to every eye,
Lack not for praise that mends the soul.
All tongues, the voice of inner sighs,
Bestow the honor that you stole.

Your outward shines with words so kind,
Yet those same voices, in their role,
Confuse the praises they once aligned,
By seeking virtue in your goal.

They see the truth in your intent,
And judge its worth by your ascent,
Then, foolishly, they misconstrue,
Their praise for you, now twisted and untrue.

But why your essence does not fit,
The picture you present, bit by bit,
The reason lies within your wit,
For common ground obscures your brilliance's hit."
70,1,"Innocence should not bear the weight of blame,
For falsehood's taint clings to the fairest skin;
Beauty's adornment bears the cruelest game,
A raven soaring in the heavens' glee begin.
So if you're true, the whispers but confirm
Your worth, more precious as it's sought by time;
The poisoned vices love the sweetest worm,
And you present a flawless bloom, sublime.
You've traversed the snares of youthful days,
Untouched or triumphant, bearing no scars;
Yet this, your praise, cannot be the close of days,
Nor bind the envy swelling amongst stars.
  If guileless virtue hides behind no veil,
  Then you, and only you, shall claim hearts' tale.

"
70,2,"Let not the blot of blame be laid on thee,
For slander's mark is ever drawn on bright;
The fair's ornament, a paradox, shall be
A raven in the midst of purest light.
So if your soul be true, the whispers' spite
Shall but approve your worth, refined by strife;
The bitter vices seek the sweetest bite,
And you, a gem, remain amidst life.
Unscathed by youth's ambushes, cunning traps,
You've left them far behind, or stood as victor;
Yet this, your praise, cannot be held in laps,
Lest envy grow, forever a pursuer.
  If innocence unmarred by shadows lies,
  Then you, and only you, shall claim the skies.

"
70,3,"The mark of blame should not be thine to claim,
For slander's breath has ever sought the fair;
The ornament of beauty bears the shame,
A raven soaring high in sweetest air.
So if your heart be pure, the whispers' game
Shall but enhance your worth, as stars align;
The cruelest vices seek the sweetest fame,
And you, a beacon, burn with light divine.
Through the trials of your youth, you've left behind
The traps of envy, bearing no regrets;
Yet this, your praise, cannot be confined,
Nor held as ransom by the debt of bets.
  If unsullied virtue shines so bright,
  Then you, and only you, shall hold the light."
71,1,"Cease now your lament when I have departed,
Only the somber tolling bell shall tell
Of my release from this world, tainted, blighted,
To find peace with the lowly worms as well.
Rather, if you chance upon this written word,
Forget the writer's touch, for love runs deep,
In your fond memories, let my name be blurred,
Lest sorrow stirred should cause your heart to weep.
Oh, should you peruse this humble verse,
When I, perhaps, am joined with earthly clay,
Do not so much as whisper my name, submerge
My memory, let it fade softly away.
  Lest curious minds should glimpse your sorrowed gaze
  And taunt you with my name beyond the grave.

"
71,2,"Now refrain from weeping when my days are done,
The mournful bell will speak of my departure,
From this cruel world, to dwell with earth and sun,
In the company of lowly, simple creatures.
Yet, should you find these lines I penned with care,
Forget the hand that traced them on this page,
For love's sweet power will conquer despair,
If thoughts of me should bring but pain and rage.
Ah, should you read this humble verse of mine,
When I, perhaps, have become one with the soil,
Let not my name cross your lips, do not whine,
Let love's own tribute be my quiet spoil.
  Lest those who see your sadness mock your plight,
  And use my name to fuel their thoughtless spite.

"
71,3,"Withhold your tears when I have left this place,
The solemn knell will herald my farewell,
From this harsh world, to find a gentler space,
Among the humble earthworms who know it well.
But if you happen on this written phrase,
Forget the one who wove this heartfelt song,
For love's pure light will quell the darkest haze,
If thoughts of me should bring but grief and wrong.
Oh, should you encounter this simple verse,
When I, perhaps, am merged with earth and root,
Speak not my name, let memories disperse,
Let love's own eulogy be my pursuit.
  Lest those who witness your sorrow should scoff,
  And wield my name as part of their reproof."
72,1,"Ah, should the world demand you to reveal
The cause of love that stirs within your heart,
Forget me, dear, once I have left this earthly realm,
As nothing noble in me can claim your part.

But if you'd weave a tale of virtues I lack,
To elevate me higher than I ever flew,
And heap praises on my humble shoulders' rack,
A falsehood spun to honor me anew.

Lest your true love appears as deceit,
Speak kindly of me, yet honestly,
Let my name rest where my body shall meet,
No longer causing us either shame or glee.

For I am flawed, and what I bring to light,
Deserves no love, and you, no blame in this plight.

"
72,2,"Oh, if the world should ask you to expound
On the reason love for me exists,
Forget my soul, once I am underground,
For I am unworthy of your heart's gists.

Yet, if you'd craft a myth of valor I've earned,
To grace my name with honor I did not earn,
And sing my praises, though my deeds were spurned,
A lie conceived to keep my memory warm.

Lest your true love seems a falsified tale,
Speak well of me, but keep it truthful still,
My name should fade, as my body grows pale,
No longer causing us both grief or thrill.

For I am weak, and what I leave behind,
Deserves no love, and you, no censure, kind.

"
72,3,"Oh, should the world request you to disclose,
The grounds for love that thrives in you for me,
Forget my face, when I no longer rose,
For I am empty, unfit to harbor thee.

But if you'd spin a yarn of virtues I've gained,
To dignify my name with honor untold,
And celebrate my deeds, though undeserved fame,
A fiction spun to guard my memory bold.

Lest your true love resembles feigned delight,
Speak kindly of me, but keep it real,
My name should wane, as I depart from sight,
No longer causing us both sorrow or zeal.

For I am lost, and what I leave behind,
Deserves no love, and you, no guilt, unconfined."
73,1,"When you look upon me, find the season
Where autumn's hues in shades of gold are cast,
And though the leaves have thinned, or not yet fallen,
Upon my branches, winter's chill is vast.
Behold these boughs, like choirs, once filled with song,
Now empty, save for ghosts of melodies;
The sweet birds' nests abandoned, chilled, forlorn,
A symphony of silence, echoing trees.
In me, you glimpse the fading sun's embrace,
That golden orb, which sinks into the night,
A prelude to the darkness, cold, and lifeless,
The second death, which seals the day in plight.
Yet, in this twilight, see the ember's glow,
The fire of life, still burning, burning low.

"
73,2,"In my visage, mark the autumnal tide,
When leaves, like memories, cling to limbs and fade,
And in the cold, the boughs that shake and sigh,
Are but the remnants of a choir once made.
Observe the few remaining leaves of gold,
That whisper tales of summer days long past,
A testament to warmth and light of old,
Now fading, like the day's own fleeting cast.
In me, you find the dusk's encroaching hold,
That creeping shadow, stealing life away,
The second death, that ends the day of light,
Embracing all in its eternal sway.
Within this waning day, an ember burns,
The fire of life, through which our youth returns.

"
73,3,"Gaze upon my countenance, and there you'll find
The autumnal hues of fading life's display,
Where leaves, like dreams, cling to the branches' mind,
Or fall away, to winter's chill, they sway.
These boughs, once filled with birds that sweetly sang,
Now shiver, bare and cold, against the breeze,
Their songs now silenced, as the night grows long,
A testament to life's brief, fragile ease.
In me, you'll see the twilight's fading gleam,
That golden orb, which sinks into the night,
A harbinger of darkness, cold, and gloom,
The second death, which seals the day from sight.
Yet, in this fading day, an ember glows,
The fire of life, that flickers, ebbs, and flows."
74,1,"Yet find satisfaction in the bound arrest
That, without recourse, will convey me hence,
For in these verses lies an investment,
A keepsake for you, of our recompense.
In this revisiting, you peruse not words,
But rather, that which was devoted to thee,
The earth may claim its clay, as is deserved,
But my essence, the superior part, belongs to thee.
Thus, you have lost but life's residue,
The carrion for worms, when my body's shed,
A craven's prize, the worthless victor's due,
Below your notice, and so, better left unsaid.
Within these lines, the true value stays,
Entwined with you, where it shall forever lay.

"
74,2,"Find peace in the unavoidable restraint
That'll draw me from life, without a chance,
For in these lines, some portion still retains
A connection to you, a lasting expanse.
Upon reflection, you but ponder on
The portion penned for you, in love and trust,
The earth may reclaim its earthly spawn,
But my spirit, the nobler part, belongs to dust.
So, you have lost mere fragments of existence,
The shell abandoned, as the worm doth feed,
The base reward of a pitiful resistance,
An insignificant foe, in you, no belief.
Within this verse, the genuine worth abides,
Inseparable, where our souls confide.

"
74,3,"Accept the inevitable confinement's force,
That'll remove me from this mortal plane,
For in these lines, a fragment of my course
Is tied to you, and shall endure, remain.
As you retrace these lines, you see once more
The part consecrated, solely, to your grace,
The earth may repossess its ancient lore,
But my spirit, the finer part, inhabits space.
Thus, you have lost but life's transient stage,
The vessel spent, as the worm takes hold,
The meager spoils of a feeble rage,
A tale unworthy, in your annals, untold.
Within this poem, the authentic treasure hides,
Bound to you, where it forever resides."
75,1,"In such a way you nestle in my mind,
As sustenance to life, or rain to earth;
A battle rages, as misers find
When guarding wealth, they cannot grasp its worth.
At times, like one who revels in his feast,
Then doubting age will steal what he adores;
Alone with you, or showing to the East
My joy, I'm torn by these insatiable pores.
My heart is full, then empty, starved, replete,
Consuming you or chasing shadows deep;
My soul finds solace in this sweet deceit,
Where all is had, or gone beyond the leap.
  So I swing back and forth, both sated, spurned,
  By feast or famine, love forever turned.

"
75,2,"As breath to lungs, or sunlight to the dawn,
Your presence in my mind is ever near;
A war within me, as a thrifty pawn
Holds fast to gold, while time steals all so dear.
Now basking in your love, like one who's dined,
Then fearing age will steal this cherished treasure;
Alone, I find contentment, but as wind
Indulges in the fragrance of a rose's pleasure.
My heart is full, then empty, famished, sated,
By your nearness or the chase, I'm left forlorn;
No sweeter joy exists, elated, or deflated,
Save what is present, or what I have not born.
  Thus, I'm ensnared in this eternal dance,
  Of plenty or of loss, in love's expanse.

"
75,3,"Like air to flame, or as the tide to shore,
Your image in my mind forever stays;
A conflicted heart, as those who hoard,
And fear the thief of time who steals away.
At times, I revel in your warm embrace,
Then doubt the future steals what I revere;
Alone, I find my solace and my grace,
Yet crave the world to know my heart's desire.
My heart is full, then empty, parched, replete,
Consumed by you, or seeking shadows deep;
My soul finds solace in this bittersweet deceit,
Where all is had, or gone beyond my reach.
  So I sway back and forth, both gorged, forlorn,
  By feast or famine, in this love, reborn."
76,1,"Why is my song so sparse in novel boast,
So distant from revisions or swift shifts?
Why, as the world turns, do I not coast
To uncharted paths and alien crafts?
Why do I pen still, ever the same,
And cling to patterns in a worn-out guise,
Each line echoing, in its age, my name,
Revealing source and ancestry likewise?
Ah, sweetest friend, in every phrase I croon,
I sing of thee, forever at the core;
Thus, I rework phrases in a brighter bloom,
Reinvesting what was spent once before.
  For, like the moon, my love is ever new,
  And in each verse, my constancy rings true.

"
76,2,"How comes my tale so scant of original gleam,
So removed from innovation or nimble turns?
Why, as the tides turn, do I not dream
Of fresh horizons and unseen concerns?
Why do I narrate, ever the same,
And grasp for phrases in a familiar mold,
That every sentence whispers my good name,
Unveiling roots and the stories they hold?
Oh, know, dear heart, in every line I pen,
I celebrate thee, my ceaseless inspiration;
Thus, I reanimate words like a faithful den,
Reviving tales of past adoration.
  For, as the stars, my love remains untold,
  In every word, its lore forever old.

"
76,3,"What keeps my craft so devoid of vibrant hue,
So estranged from evolution or dynamic flight?
Why, as the seasons change, do I not pursue
New worlds of wisdom and unseen delight?
Why do I sketch, ever the same,
And tread worn paths in a long-held pose,
That every stanza doth proclaim my name,
Revealing origins and creative throes?
Ah, sweetest muse, in every lyric I compose,
I honor thee, my everlasting theme;
Thus, I embellish phrases as they grow and blossom,
Reviving what was sung in a distant dream.
  For, as the rivers flow, my love remains untamed,
  In every rhyme, its spirit is proclaimed."
77,1,"The mirror reveals the passing of thy charms,
The clock, the swift departure of your days;
In empty pages, thoughts and memories are swarms,
From this collection, wisdom's taste will surely raise.

The lines on your face, the glass will candidly show,
Of whispered secrets from gaping graves will tell;
By the clock's shifting shadows, you'll come to know,
The fleeting march of time to the final knell.

What escapes your mind, jot down on these empty sheets,
Give life anew to ideas conceived in your head;
In revisiting these lines, both profit and sweets,
Your enriched journal, a treasure to be read.

In this oft-perused tome, find knowledge and delight,
A living testament to your intellectual flight.

"
77,2,"Thy looking glass, thy fading beauty will unveil,
The clock's unwavering hands, thy swiftly spent hours bewail;
Upon these vacant leaves, the mind's imprints shall prevail,
A lesson drawn from this record, thou shalt not fail.

The creases on thy visage, the mirror shall disclose,
Of silent graves, their whispered tales it shall supply;
By the clock's somber gait, thou shalt come to suppose,
The furtive, relentless stride towards eternity's divide.

What eludes thy memory, transcribe on these bare scrolls,
Resurrect the thoughts, from mental cradle to page unfurled;
In revisiting these lines, both wisdom and joy it doles,
An enriched chronicle, of intellect's pearls curled.

With every studied glance, this trove shall thee reward,
A living chronicle, of intellect's vast hoard.

"
77,3,"The glass in thy hand, the fading bloom shall display,
The clock's unceasing march, the swiftly waning day;
In these unwritten pages, the mind's imprints shall lay,
A lesson gleaned from this ledger, thou shalt not stray.

The lines on thy brow, the mirror shall candidly trace,
Of somber graves, their echoes in its reflection shall rise;
By the clock's solemn tick, thou shalt come to discern,
The ceaseless advance of time, to the final twilight's turn.

What slips from thy recall, inscribe on these vacant rolls,
Breathe life anew into thoughts, from mind's conceiving bowers;
In revisiting these lines, both solace and insights it bestows,
An enriched anthology, of intellect's brightest flowers.

With every pondered gaze, this archive shall thee enrich,
A living testament, of wisdom's growing pitch."
78,1,"So often I've sought your wisdom as my muse,
Inspiring me with your poetic grace,
That every stranger's pen has borrowed my use,
Dispersing their words throughout the vast space.
Your eyes, which taught the silent to find their voice,
And ignorance to rise and soar on high,
Have added wings to scholars' soaring choice,
And lent your beauty to their majesty.
Rejoice in what I pen, for it's your own,
A child begotten through our sacred bond.
In others' works, you but refine and hone,
Enhancing art with your celestial pond.
  You are my art, my wisdom, and my guide,
  Together, we transcend the mundane tide.

"
78,2,"I've called upon you countless times as my muse,
Your inspiration flows through every line,
In every stranger's hand, your touch diffuses,
Their borrowed words in verses intertwine.
Your gaze, which taught the voiceless to begin,
To sing and soar above their station,
Has granted scholars wings to rise within,
And added beauty to their elocution.
Behold what I have wrought, for it's your own,
A testament to our eternal bond,
In others' works, you but refine and atone,
Enriching art with your ethereal wand.
  You are my art, my wisdom, and my fire,
  Together, we ascend to greater skies.

"
78,3,"My muse, so often have I summoned your aid,
Your inspiration lends my words their grace,
In every stranger's script, your essence pervades,
Their borrowed verses spread through time and space.
Your eyes, which taught the mute to find their song,
And raised the humble spirit ever higher,
Have granted scholars wings to fly along,
And lent your charm to their poetic fire.
Take pride in what I've crafted in your name,
For it's your essence, pure and undilute,
In others' works, you but fan the flame,
Bestowing art with your enchanting fruit.
  You are my art, my wisdom, and my guide,
  Together, we traverse the endless tide."
79,1,"When I, the lone bard, sought your guidance fair,
Your grace adorned my verse with gentle charm;
But now my muse, once vibrant, lies in despair,
And yields her place to another's harmonic balm.

My love, your allure inspires words so grand,
Yet falls short of the muse they seek to praise;
For every virtue and beauty in my hand,
I've borrowed from your being's radiant blaze.

I steal your splendor, then return it in kind,
A tribute to the matchless jewel you are;
In you, these qualities I hope to find,
And hold aloft the mirror to your star.

So thank not me for praises I bestow,
For all I owe, you in yourself do show.

"
79,2,"In solitude, I summoned thee to light,
And in my verse, your gentle spirit thrived;
But now my muse, once vibrant, takes her flight,
And leaves her grace in you, her heart's reprieve.

My love, your virtues stir the poet's soul,
Yet fall short of the wonder you contain;
For every grace I strive to extol,
I find it first within your visage's reign.

I lend you beauty, yet it's yours to claim,
For every word I offer, life has paid;
In you, these gifts I seek to reclaim,
A testament to the love you've laid.

So thank not me for praises I impart,
For all I owe, you hold within your heart.

"
79,3,"When I, the humble bard, called on thee to shine,
Your grace adorned my verse with gentle art;
But now my muse, once vibrant, fades with time,
And yields her place to another's beating heart.

My love, your essence stirs the poet's mind,
Yet falls short of the glory you convey;
For every virtue and beauty I find,
I see them first reflected in your face's array.

I borrow from your splendor, then return it thrice,
A tribute to the matchless gem you are;
In you, these qualities I long to prize,
And hold aloft the mirror to your star.

So thank not me for praises I recite,
For all I owe, you shine so very bright."
80,1,"Oh, the weakness that seizes me as I pen,
My inadequate verses for your grace,
While loftier praises from a truer ken
Ascend to you in an unbroken race.
Yet, I, a vessel of but modest might,
Do launch upon your vast and welcoming sea,
For even in your depths my spirit's light
Finds buoyancy, and drifts in rapture free.
The slightest touch of your encompassing aid
Shall keep me from the treacherous ocean's grip,
As on your boundless surface I confide,
Though he, in gilded vessel, takes his ship.
So, if he prospers and my fate's less kind,
In love, I found both strength and fortitude kind.

"
80,2,"Alas, I falter in my feeble attempt,
To capture your essence in my lines,
As loftier odes are swiftly sent,
By masters of expression, in your shrines.
Yet, I, a humble vessel on this sea,
Of boundless admiration, cast my anchor,
For in your vastness, I find the key
To buoy my spirit and expand my honor.
The gentlest breeze of your benevolent aid,
Shall keep me from the depths of sorrow's tide,
As on your welcoming surface, I wade,
Though he, in splendor, does sail by your side.
So, if he flourishes and I am lost,
In love, I've found a purpose, not a cost.

"
80,3,"Ah, the faintness that overtakes my soul,
As I, unworthy, try to frame your worth,
For lofty eulogies control
The heavens of praise, from whence they come forth.
Yet, I, a fragile boat, on seas I launch,
Of ceaseless admiration, vast and deep,
For in your boundless ocean, I find a catch,
A buoyant force that lulls my heart to sleep.
The slightest touch of your all-encompassing aid,
Shall keep me from the darkness, deep inside,
As on your welcoming surface, I glide,
Though he, in stately ship, does sail with pride.
So, if he prevails and I am cast adrift,
In love, I've found a solace, swift and swift."
81,1,"I'll pen your eulogy or you'll outlive,
Through my verse, your essence shall remain.
Though in my heart each detail may dissolve,
Your name will be eternal, uncontained.

A common grave may hold my mortal shell,
Yet, in the minds of those unborn,
You'll rise anew, in stories I did tell,
A legend born from tales of scorn.

My gentle verse, your monument, shall stand,
Unyielding to the passage of time.
Throughout the ages, in each distant land,
Your life shall thrive, in verses that rhyme.

In every breath that fills the lungs of men,
Your spirit lives, my words its vessel then.

"
81,2,"I'll craft your story, or you'll outlast,
In the realm of words, your soul shall soar.
For though my memory may slowly fade,
Your immortal name will forevermore.

A simple grave may claim my earthly form,
But in the hearts of those yet unborn,
You'll rise again, in tales of love and scorn,
A hero born from the pages torn.

My gentle verse, your monument, shall thrive,
Unbroken by the hands of time.
Through the ages, in each distant hive,
Your life shall echo, in verses that chime.

In every breath that fills the lungs of men,
Your legacy lives, my words its beacon then.

"
81,3,"I'll write your elegy, or you'll survive,
In the vast expanse of human thought.
For as my memory may cease to be,
Your name will be, in verses, wrought.

A humble grave may cradle my decay,
But in the minds of generations hence,
You'll rise anew, in stories they convey,
A timeless soul, in verses that dance.

My gentle verse, your monument, shall endure,
Unyielding to the ravages of time.
Through the ages, in each distant lure,
Your life shall resonate, in verses that rhyme.

In every breath that fills the lungs of men,
Your spirit thrives, my words its sacred den."
82,1,"I acknowledge you're not bound to my inspiration,
Thus, unstained, you may peruse
The consecrated words that authors employ
For their cherished theme, gracing every piece.
Your wisdom matches your beauty, surpassing
My humble tributes, compelling a quest
For a newer, brighter imprint of progress,
Seeking fresher echoes of time's zenith.
Go then, and let them invent
Elaborate phrases to embellish your grace,
Yet, in your essence, you shall remain
Unaltered, understood by a sincere confidant.
  Their heavy-handed artistry is best
  For rosy cheeks; in you, it is misplaced.

"
82,2,"I admit you hold no bond to my poetic vision,
So wander then, unburdened, through
The sacred phrases that writers weave
For their ideal muse, adorning each opus.
Your intellect rivals your beauty, transcending
My feeble praises, demanding a search
For a purer, truer expression of ascent,
Craving purer whispers of tomorrow.
Pursue that path, and let them strive
To capture your essence in gilded verse,
Yet, in your truth, you will remain
Unchanged, embraced by a faithful ally.
  Their lavish attempts may grace
  Another's form; in you, they lose their place.

"
82,3,"I confess you've no tie to my artistic fancy,
So roam, unfettered, through
The devoted words that scribes imbue
For their revered source, enhancing every work.
Your wisdom mirrors your beauty, outshining
My clumsy eulogies, inciting a quest
For a nobler, clearer articulation of rise,
Yearning for truer utterances of the apex.
Advance, then, and let them endeavor
To immortalize you in ornate prose,
Yet, in your nature, you will stay
Unblemished, cherished by a loyal comrade.
  Their elaborate designs may serve
  On borrowed beauty; in you, they swerve."
83,1,"In adorning beauty, I thought it best
To let your visage speak for itself,
Unveiled by words, in which I'd only jest,
And leave your grace to shine, devoid of stealth.
So I have kept my silence, as my vow,
To let your truth be seen, not defined,
By mortal tongue, which cannot endow
The depth of soul that in you I've find.
This quietness, once deemed a transgression,
Shall be my pride, in your bright presence,
For I corrupt not beauty, in my obsessive
Silence, while others mar with eloquence.
  In one of your lovely eyes, there blooms
  More life than poets' praises ever assume.

"
83,2,"No need for paint, I thought, to grace your face,
For you, my muse, surpass all artful strokes.
I saw your inner light and took my place,
A humble bard, in your vast wakes.
My silence, then, was but homage meet,
A quiet hymn to your resplendent state,
As I, a poet, stood on tiptoe, fleet,
To glimpse the heights your spirit would create.
This hush, once deemed a failing, now I see,
A strength, a shield, 'gainst hollow flattery,
For I corrupt not beauty, holding back,
While others wound with words, too sharp, too brittle, too tacky.
  In one of your bright eyes, life's festival
  Unfolds, a spectacle no poet can unravel.

"
83,3,"No brush, I thought, could match your hue,
Nor words, my dear, could e'er encompass thee.
So I stood mute, in awe, and let you through,
My heart, my art, to be your gallery.
In quietude, I paid my deepest debt,
To one who shines beyond all mortal speech,
And as I watched, I learned to forget
The trappings of a poet's reach.
This silence, once a fault, I now proclaim,
A badge of honor, as I stand in awe,
For I corrupt not beauty, playing your game,
While others mar with words, too raw, too flawed, too shallow.
  In one of your fair eyes, life's symphony
  Plays on, a melody no poet can disown."
84,1,"One alone, whose match no other can claim,
In you resides the treasure, the unique name.
The humble writer, when your praise they sing,
Finds their own worth reflected, in you they see a king.
Your essence, captured in words, transcends,
Bringing life to paper, glory to its ends.
Yet, beware the allure of excessive fame,
For it may mar the beauty of your flawless frame.
True praise lies in honest, clear reflection,
Not in inflated phrases or hollow affection.

"
84,2,"Who can surpass the accolades you've earned,
Only you, in your true, unmatched form?
The scribe who chronicles your matchless grace,
Finds ample splendor in your sacred space.
Your virtues, inscribed, become their art,
As they mirror your essence, near to heart.
Yet, seek not endless applause, nor yearn,
For false praise only the hollow shall earn.
True honor springs from genuine delight,
In the radiance of your pure, inner light.

"
84,3,"Who can express the wonder that you are,
Save for you, the star that shines afar?
The poet, when they sing your sacred praise,
Reveals their soul, in your resplendent haze.
Your qualities, inscribed, become their song,
As they echo your truth, where they belong.
But, beware the trap of hollow acclaim,
For it blinds the heart, and dulls the brain.
True glory thrives in honest esteem,
In the brilliance of your genuine beam."
85,1,"My tongue-tied muse, in reverence, stays silent,
As accolades for you, in golden lines,
With richly drawn comparisons, are built,
In prose and verse, by the muses' grace, refined.
I contemplate kind thoughts, while others pen
Their praises, in elegant and polished form.
As humble scribe, I echo their ""Amen,""
To every hymn, by gifted minds performed.
Upon hearing your encomiums, I concur,
""Indeed, it's true!""—and then, in silent awe,
Bestow a deeper love, in mind's secluded purview,
Where words may lag, but feelings hold their draw.
So others celebrate your words, they say,
I celebrate your essence, in my way.

"
85,2,"My muse, confined, withholds her voice,
As tributes to you, in golden script,
With elegant phrases, carefully crafted,
By the muses' hands, are herein scripted.
I harbor favorable thoughts, while others write
Their eloquent praises, in refined prose.
As unversed bard, I add my ""Amen,""
To every song, by nimble minds composed.
When hailing your virtues, I attest,
""Indeed, 'tis true!""—and then, within,
Bestow a warmer love, in heart's quiet nest,
Where words may falter, yet affection thrives.
Thus others cheer your words, they claim,
I cherish you, in silence, all the same.

"
85,3,"My muse, with reverence, holds her peace,
As eulogies to you, in golden verse,
With polished phrases, by the muses penned,
In splendid array, here find their place.
I harbor kindred thoughts, while others scribe
Their fervent praises, in eloquent speech.
As unpracticed poet, I affirm
Each encomium, by keen minds conceived.
Upon hearing your acclaim, I assent,
""Indeed, 'tis so!""—and then, within,
A deeper love, in mind's secluded firmament,
I nurture, where words may seldom tread.
So others laud your words, they say,
I laud your spirit, in my quiet way."
86,1,"Was it the lofty ship of his grand discourse,
Bound for the lure of you, so coveted,
That sank my thoughts in brain's deep-rooted source,
In death's own womb, where life's seeds were sown and spread?

Or was it his spirit, by spectral hands inspired,
Writing beyond earthly reach, which stole my breath?
No, neither he nor those nocturnal bards conspired,
Aiding his cause, my verse they failed to quell or repress.

He, nor the ghostly presence, ever near,
Whispering wisdom in the hush of night,
Could claim triumph o'er my hush, made clear;
I entertained no dread, no fright, no blight.

Yet when your visage graced his written word,
My voice faltered, lost to your enchanting allure.

"
86,2,"Was it the towering mast of his eloquent speech,
Seeking the treasure of your heart, so desired,
That anchored my musings in thought's ocean's reach,
In the tomb of mind, where ideas were conceived and fired?

Or was it his soul, by spectral muses taught,
Scribing beyond mortal limits, that left me numb?
No, neither he, nor his nocturnal scribes, fraught
With aid, my verse they failed to overwhelm or stun.

He, nor the ghostly guide, his penance paid,
Whispering wisdom in night's hushed serenade,
Could claim victory over my silence, displayed;
I harbored not a single thread of dread.

But when your face adorned his written page,
My voice retreated, robbed of strength by age.

"
86,3,"Was it the soaring wing of his grand oration,
Seeking the haven of your love, so yearned for,
That lodged my thoughts in heart's grand foundation,
In the crypt of soul, where dreams were born and stored?

Or was it his essence, by shades instructed,
Scribing past mortal bounds, that left me cold and drained?
No, neither he, nor his nightly comrades, busted,
Aiding his quest, my verse they failed to claim or stain.

He, nor the spectral muse, his debt now paid,
Whispering wisdom in the night's tranquil parade,
Could claim dominion over my silence, displayed;
I bore no burden of a fear, long-faded.

Yet when your image filled his written design,
My voice was lost, defeated by your divine."
87,1,"Adieu, too precious for my sole ownership,
Your value, I suspect, you're well aware.
The title to your worth sets you free henceforth;
My claims on you, in every aspect, rare.
How can I own you but by your permission,
And for that treasure, where is my deserving?
The reason for this generous remission,
In me, is absent, thus my claim is swerving.
In ignorance, you gave yourself away,
Or to the one who received it, erred;
Thus, magnanimously, your gift at play,
On second thought, it finds its rightful guard.
  A fleeting dream, like kings we've been in slumber,
  Awake, we find ourselves in quite anotherumber.

"
87,2,"Farewell, too costly for my mere containing,
And likely, well aware, you are your price.
The title deed to your value, unconstraining,
My hold on you, in every aspect, not nice.
How could I keep you but by your assenting,
And for such riches, where is my deserving?
The cause of this munificent presenting,
In me, is lacking, thus my claim is swerving.
Unknowingly, you granted yourself, before,
Knowing not the worth of what you gave,
Or to whom you gave it, that much is sure,
So generously, your gift began to pave.
  A dream's illusion, kings we've been in reverie,
  Awake, no royalty does our sight decree.

"
87,3,"Adieu, too noble for my singular housing,
And surely, you must know, your value's height.
The charter of your worth, with no rehousing,
My ties to you, in every aspect, slight.
How could I possess you but by your condoning,
And for such wealth, where is my deserving?
The reason for this bountiful bestowing,
In me, is absent, thus my claim is swerving.
In innocence, you granted yourself away,
Or to the one who held it, in mistake;
Thus, with great grace, your gift on display,
On wiser judgment, it its path does take.
  A fleeting shadow, kings we've been in twilight,
  Awake, no scepter shines in day's clear light."
88,1,"When you deem me of little worth,
And cast my value in disdain,
Beside you, I will wage my fight,
To prove your virtue, though you feign.

With my own flaws, I am well-versed,
Upon your deeds, I can unfurl
A tale of hidden faults, rehearsed,
That, in my loss, you'll gain a pearl.

And thus, I'll gain as well, you see,
For focusing all my love on you,
The wounds I give myself, set free,
Strengthen our bond, a double-hue.

My love is such, to you, I cling,
For your vindication, I shall bring.

"
88,2,"On that day when scorn adorns your gaze,
And my worth fades in your esteem,
By your side, I'll raise my blade,
To champion virtue in your dream.

My own faults, I've come to know,
In your transgressions, I shall lay
A chronicle of secrets, so
You'll rise in triumph come what may.

In this plight, I too shall find,
A boon in focusing on your grace,
For every wound, self-inflicted, binds,
Our love, two souls, in one embrace.

My love, thus bound, I'll play my part,
For your true heart, I'll bear the smart.

"
88,3,"In the moment you debase my worth,
And cast my virtues to the ground,
I'll join your cause, and fight with mirth,
To prove your merit all around.

My weaknesses, I understand,
And in your errors, I perceive,
A chance to make my stand,
And let our love's true power weave.

As I recount the faults concealed,
Your triumph in my loss will grow,
And I, in turn, shall feel,
The sweetness of this love's ebb and flow.

My love, so deep, I'll play the role,
For your true worth, I'll pay the toll."
89,1,"If you should claim my absence is my fault,
I'll contemplate and address that transgression;
Speak of my flaws, and I shall surely halt,
In response to your reasons, offer no objection.
You could never harm me with harsher words,
Setting conditions on the longing for change,
Than I could, knowing your desires, incur,
By choking off connections, feigning estrangement,
Avoiding paths we once walked side by side,
Erasing your treasured name from my speech,
Lest I should tarnish its sanctity, and confide
In others, profaning the love we preach.
For your sake, I'll oppose myself, indeed,
For I cannot love one for whom you feel no need.

"
89,2,"If you should charge me with abandonment,
I'll ponder and respond to your reproach;
Speak of my missteps, and I'll come to a standstill,
In light of your reasons, I'll offer no defense.
You cannot wound me more deeply than I,
By embracing the change you deem necessary,
Strangling the bond between us, feigning disdain,
Avoiding the places where we once roamed,
Expelling your cherished name from my heart,
Lest I should tarnish its value, and share
The tale of our love, now profaned and torn apart,
With others, who'd never understand our care.
For your sake, I'll fight against my own heart,
For I cannot love one for whom you have no part.

"
89,3,"If you should charge me with desertion,
I'll contemplate and address your complaint;
Speak of my shortcomings, and I shall halt,
In response to your reasons, I'll make no argument.
You cannot harm me more grievously than I,
By accepting the change you deem essential,
Stifling the love that once bound us together,
Feigning indifference, avoiding your gaze,
Erasing your sweet name from my memory,
Lest I should tarnish its meaning, and speak
Of our past love, now tainted and broken in two,
To those who would never comprehend our hearts' bleed.
For your sake, I'll oppose myself, I vow,
For I cannot love one for whom you feel revulsion now."
90,1,"Then despise me as you choose, if e'er, anon,
Now, as the world aligns to thwart my way,
Join hands with fickle fate and bid me stoop,
Do not delay your wrath for a later day.
Ah, do not, when my soul has weathered this storm,
Creep in upon the heels of vanquished pain;
Bestow not following darkness after storm,
To draw out fate's intended ruin's reign.
If you must leave, then part not in the end,
When lesser woes have had their wicked play,
But come upon me swift; thus, I shall comprehend
The utmost force of ill fortune's disarray;
  And other trials of grief, which now appear dire,
  Shall fade in light of losing you, my sire.

"
90,2,"Scorn me at your leisure, if thou desire, now,
As now the world conspires to bring me low,
Embrace the scorn of chance and make me bend,
Let not your scorn arrive on Fortune's slow.
Ah, do not, when this sorrow I have surmounted,
Sneak in upon the heels of woe outworn;
Grant not a tempest's night a stormy morn,
To stretch the hand of ruin further torn.
If you abandon me, do not depart,
When petty griefs have played their bitter part,
But strike me first; thus, I'll know at heart
The fullest brunt of fate's divisive art;
  And other pangs of woe, which now seem cruel,
  Shall seem less harsh compared to losing you as fool.

"
90,3,"Turn from me if you must, when ready, now,
While fortune's malice bends to thwart my vow,
Join with her scorn and bid me bow my head,
Do not delay your scorn for future's brow.
Ah, do not, when this sorrow I have left,
Creep in upon the heels of conquered pain;
Bestow not darkness after storm's relief,
To lengthen fate's intended ruin's reign.
If you depart, then leave not in the end,
When lesser griefs have played their wicked game,
But come upon me swift; thus, I shall comprehend
The fullest weight of ill fortune's blame;
  And other trials of woe, which now appear dire,
  Shall fade in light of losing thee, my fire."
91,1,"Some find pride in their lineage, some in their art,
Some in their gold, some in their physical might,
Some in their fashion, a superficial start,
Some in their birds of prey and steeds of stature's height.
And every preference harbors its delight,
A joy that eclipses all other forms.
Yet, these aspects hold no sway in my sight,
For I've found a joy that adorns and transforms.
Your love surpasses noble birth, to me,
Enriches more than gold, uplifts me higher than finery,
Brings delight beyond the thrill of the chase or speed of steeds;
In your affection, I take pride, boasting of my needs.
Alas, that you could strip me of this solace,
Leaving me bereft, devoid of any solace.

"
91,2,"In their origin, some find cause for pride,
Some in their talents, others in their earthly treasure,
Some in their bodies, strength they cannot hide,
Some in their clothes, the trendy fashion's pleasure.
And every choice has its attendant pleasure,
A joy that outshines all other sources.
But these trappings do not bring me to measure,
Another joy has captured all my sources.
Your love outweighs high birth, to me,
Enriches more than wealth, uplifts me higher than finery's glamour,
Brings delight beyond the lure of the hunt or swift steeds;
In your affection, I find pride, shouting aloud my needs.
Yet, if you were to snatch this solace away,
I'd be left lamenting, in utter disarray.

"
91,3,"Some take pride in their origin, some in their mastery,
Some in their riches, some in their physical might,
Some in their clothes, the new fashion's vanity,
Some in their hawks and horses, their dazzling sight.
And every inclination has its chosen delight,
A joy that surpasses all other joys.
Yet, these aspects do not bring me to light,
Another joy has captured all my poise.
Your love outshines high birth, to me,
Enriches more than wealth, uplifts me higher than finery's charm,
Brings delight beyond the thrill of the hunt or horses' swiftness;
In your affection, I find pride, declaring my needs.
Alas, if you should take this joy from my sight,
I'd be left desolate, in utter plight."
92,1,"Yet dare to flee, you cannot escape,
My life's companion, fate has bound us close,
And life itself exists in love's sweet shape,
Which pulses with the beat of your heart's throes.
No harm can mar me while your love remains,
For life's slightest touch can sever love's strong thread,
In joy or sorrow, love remains the chains
That bind us in a union blessed and red.
I fear not fickleness, for life's tied to
Your love, and thus, I rest in bliss and peace.
O, what a joy it is to share this bond,
To love and live, and in that love, release.
  But what's so perfect that it fears no flaw?
  Love's truth may hide, and we may know it not.

"
92,2,"Go then, and flee, your flight is all in vain,
For as the sun does chase the moon away,
My love will follow you, through joy and pain,
Our fates entwined, no force can break the sway.
Life's breath depends upon the love we share,
And when that love is lost, so too, life fades,
For love's sweet touch does shape the very air
We breathe, and in its absence, shadows wade.
No storm can shake me, for my heart is bound
To yours, and thus, I'll stand, through tempests fierce.
O, what a gift, to share this love profound,
To cherish life, and in that love, immerse.
  But what's so steadfast that it fears no shift?
  Love's compass may point true, or veer adrift.

"
92,3,"Venture away, your absence I'll withstand,
For life and love are in your heart confined,
And as the tide ebbs, then flows on desert sands,
Our love shall never leave my soul behind.
Life's fragile thread is woven by your grace,
And when that thread is cut, life too shall cease,
For love's embrace sustains us in its place,
A haven where our souls find sweet release.
No fear can touch me, for my heart is yours,
And in that love, I find my solace deep.
O, what a gift, to share this love that soars,
To cherish life, and in that love, to keep.
  But what's so sacred that it fears no harm?
  Love's promise may waver, or remain firm."
93,1,"As I persist, assuming your constancy,
I resemble a husband, blind to deceit;
My heart beholds love's visage, ever gracious,
Though you've turned your affection to retreat.
No malice dwells in your enchanting gaze,
A mystery I cannot penetrate;
In others' countenance, false hearts display
Their twisted tales in the lines they create.
Yet in your creation, heaven did conspire
To grace your face with love's eternal fire;
Whatever thoughts or secret heart desires,
Your visage speaks but sweetness, kindling higher.
  Your beauty blooms, an apple ripe with grace,
  If inner worth does not match outward face.

"
93,2,"Should I abide, trusting in your loyalty,
My plight mirrors that of a deceived spouse;
Love's semblance lingers in your countenance,
Though your affection now to others flows.
No scorn resides within your fathomless eyes,
A riddle I cannot unravel or read;
In countless faces, the counterfeit guise
Of false hearts etched in scowls and wrinkles spread.
But in your aspect, heaven's will decreed
That everlasting love should therein dwell;
Whatever thoughts or secret heart concedes,
Your looks reveal naught but sweetness to compel.
  Your charm unfolds, an apple ripe with zest,
  If purest heart does not confirm outer quest.

"
93,3,"If I endure, believing in your faith,
My state resembles that of a cuckolded mate;
Love's semblance lingers in your form, though changed,
And thus, I'm left in ignorance to wait.
No rancor dwells within your tranquil sight,
A puzzle I cannot unravel nor solve;
In myriad faces, the false hearts' plight
Is scribed in furrows, scowls, and creases groove.
But in your mien, the heavens did conspire
To fix love's visage, kindling endless delight;
Whatever thoughts or secret heart inspires,
Your looks disclose naught but sweetness, day and night.
  Your beauty shines, an apple ripe with hue,
  If truest love does not its promise ensue."
94,1,"Those who possess the strength to harm yet refrain,
Who show their greatest deeds through inaction,
With gentle touch they move the hearts of stone,
Unmoved themselves, they resist temptation's lure.
Such souls inherit heaven's choicest blessings,
Preserving nature's bounty without waste,
In their own image, they are truly cast,
Stewards of their virtues, others trace.
The summer's bloom is dear to summer's heart,
Yet lives and dies for its own solace;
But if this blossom falls to basest art,
The humblest weed may claim its rightful place.
For noblest things, by actions tainted, grow vile,
Fair lilies rot with a more loathsome smell than wild.

"
94,2,"Individuals with might to wound but won't,
Whose truest selves in stillness are displayed,
Who stir the hearts of flint, themselves remain,
Impassive, cold, and to allure unchanged.
These souls are granted heaven's choicest gifts,
Conserving nature's wealth from wasteful loss,
Their visage mirrors their own nobility,
Others but keepers of their high-born grace.
The summer's blossom pleases summer's eye,
Though lives and breathes for its own pleasure;
But if this bloom encounters vilest plight,
The lowliest weed may rise to its stature.
For purest things, by deeds defiled, turn vile,
Lilies that fester stink worse than the soil.

"
94,3,"Those gifted with might to harm yet hold it back,
Whose greatest feats are in their quietude,
Who stir the hearts of stone, yet unperturbed,
Immovable, slow to yield to allure.
Such souls inherit heaven's richest treasures,
Preserving nature's wealth from needless waste,
Their faces bear the mark of their own worth,
Others but guardians of their brightness rare.
The summer's flower charms summer's soul,
Existing for itself, it lives and dies;
But if this bloom is touched by foulest blight,
The humblest weed may claim its rightful prize.
For finest things, by actions tainted, grow vile,
Lilies that rot smell far fouler than the wild."
95,1,"In what sweet grace dost thou disguise the stain
That marrs the bloom of thy esteemed renown!
How artfully thy sins are woven in twain
Within the tapestry of thy virtuous crown!
That voice, which narrates life's chronicle,
Bestows a gentle touch upon thy sinful deeds;
Thy name, when spoken, does the ill annul,
A curse transformed by honeyed words it needs.
O, what a temple for transgressions found
A home within thee, where grace and guilt abide,
Where flaws are hidden by the sacred gown,
And ugliness transformed by truth's sweet guide!
  Beware, sweet heart, of this grand disguise;
  A sharpened sword, when blunted, shall still rise.

"
95,2,"With what sweet charm dost thou conceal the blot
That tarnishes the luster of thy name!
How gracefully thy sins are interwoven, knotted
In the fabric of thy hard-won fame!
That tongue, which speaks of days gone by,
Enshrouds thy sins in soft and tender words,
Thy name, when uttered, turns the lie
Into a truth, as songbirds sing their chords.
O, what a haven for vice has made its nest
In thee, where beauty's veil conceals each vice,
Where darkness hides behind a sunlit crest,
And sins are cloaked by the guise of sacrifice!
  Take heed, dear heart, of this seductive mask;
  A gilded cage, when opened, still may bask.

"
95,3,"How sweetly dost thou veil the disgrace
That dims the splendor of thy cherished name!
How cunningly thy sins find their embrace
Within the fortress of thy honored fame!
That voice, which whispers tales of yore,
Enshrouds thy sins in gentle, soothing tones,
Thy name, when heard, does evil restore
To innocence, as if by angels flown.
O, what a sanctuary for sin has chosen
To dwell within thee, where grace and guilt unite,
Where shadows flee before the dawn has broken,
And darkness fades before the morning light!
  Beware, sweet heart, of this beguiling grace;
  A jeweled scepter, when misused, still has place."
96,1,"Some claim it's your youth, others your allure;
Some praise your grace, your frolicsome nature adore.
Both flaws and charm ensnare hearts, pure and obscure;
In you, defects turn into sought-after lore.

As on a queen's hand, the humblest gem may shine,
In you, perceived faults become truths divine.
How many hearts could the fierce wolf then enshrine,
If he wore the fleece of a gentle lamb, so fine?

How many souls would follow your radiant path,
If you'd harness all your splendor and wrath?
Yet, exercise restraint; I cherish you, thus:
Mine is your virtue, as you are mine to claim.

"
96,2,"They whisper that your youth is your undoing,
Or that your charm lies in your playful mood.
Both grace and error, to many enchanting,
In you, are transformed, becoming the chosen few.

As on a queen's finger, the meekest stone may gleam,
In you, perceived faults become the purest dream.
How many hearts could the lone wolf then redeem,
If he wore the guise of a gentle lamb, serene?

How many hearts would you captivate and sway,
If you unleashed your full mighty, dazzling array?
Still, hold your course; I love you as you are:
Mine is your essence, as you are mine to hold.

"
96,3,"Some say your youth is your transgression,
Others claim it's your grace that steals their hearts.
Both flaws and beauty, to many a confession,
In you, become virtues, setting apart.

As on a queen's hand, the simplest gem may glow,
In you, perceived errors become radiant traits.
How many hearts could the lonely wolf bestow,
If he donned the fleece of a lamb, so great?

How many souls would you ensnare and lead,
If you revealed the strength that you've long since bred?
Restrain yourself; I love you all the more,
Mine is your spirit, as you are mine to adore."
97,1,"In winter's guise has my absence shaped,
A season's chill 'twixt us has crept.
Bleak frosts I've known, skies darkly draped,
Where once was warmth, now vacancy is swept.

This time apart, a summer's grace,
A fertile autumn's swell held dear.
Yet, barren joy in solace placed,
Like hollow vessels yearning for their seer.

The fruits of love, abandoned, lone,
Save for the echo of your laughter's ring.
For you are sun, and all is sown,
In your absence, even birds don't sing.
  Or if they do, their voices lack all mirth,
  Paling leaves foretell the frost's rebirth.

"
97,2,"My lengthy absence, like a winter's pall,
Cast shadows long upon our shared delight.
Ice-cold memories of you did call,
As autumn's bounty hid from daylight.

This separation, cloaked in summer's guise,
Brought teeming life, yet empty comfort near.
Fruitful and full, yet lacking your eyes,
Like orphaned crops, devoid of father's cheer.

The summer sun, your smile's gentle blaze,
Lies dormant, while you wander far away.
Beneath the sunless skies, birds' songs haze,
In your absence, winter steals the day.
  If melody rings, it bears a heavy heart,
  A mournful tune, as winter sets its part.

"
97,3,"My prolonged absence, like a winter's sigh,
Crept in between us, cold and bleak.
Frozen moments, shadows on the sky,
Replaced the warmth that once did speak.

This time apart, a summer's grace,
An autumn's fullness, rich and ripe.
Yet, joy without you held no place,
Like abandoned nests, devoid of life.

The fruits of love, once bright and gay,
Now wilted, lifeless, in your stead.
For you are summer, and they decay,
In your absence, even birds have fled.
  Or if they stay, their songs are tinged with loss,
  A winter's whisper, in summer's gloss."
98,1,"In your presence, springtime has been unseen,
As April, in finery, dances with glee,
Bestowing vitality on every green,
Even stern Saturn smiles at such revelry.
The songs of birds, the fragrant blossoms' array,
Could not inspire my tongue to sing or say,
A summer's tale, nor from earth's embrace take,
The flowers that in gardens of delight lay.
I did not ponder the lily's pure attire,
Nor marvel at the rose's crimson allure,
For they were merely echoes of your fire,
The paragon of beauty, forever pure.
And thus, in absence, winter still holds sway,
With your memory, I while away the day.

"
98,2,"Away from you, I've missed the spring's embrace,
When April, in finery, leaps and sings,
Inspiring heavy Saturn to give chase,
And laugh with joy that the cold days end.
The birds' sweet carols, flowers' varied bloom,
Could not my heart or lips to speak entice,
Of summer's tales, nor pluck its vibrant plume,
From gardens graced by Nature's sacrifice.
I marked not the lily's spotless array,
Nor praised the rose's rich and fiery glow,
For they were but shadows of your play,
Your visage, the wellspring from which beauty flows.
In your absence, winter's chill remains,
And in your shadow, I find sweet pains.

"
98,3,"In your absence, spring has lost its grace,
As April, in finery, dances alone,
And Saturn, heavy-hearted, seeks embrace,
To chase the winter chill from bone and bone.
The birds' sweet songs, the flowers' scents unfurled,
Could not my tongue or quill to speak provoke,
Of summer's stories, nor the blooms unswirl,
From gardens where such blossoms gently stoke.
I marked not the lily's pure, white attire,
Nor praised the rose's deep and fiery blush,
For they were but reflections of your tire,
Your visage, the lodestar of beauty's hush.
In your absence, winter's grip stays fast,
And in your shadow, I am held steadfast."
99,1,"I addressed the violet in advance:
""Sweet plunderer, where did you filch your charm,
If not from my beloved's sweet expanse?
The purple hue on your delicate balm
Is drawn from my love's veins, so I am told.
You've robbed their splendor, in your visage so bold.""

The lily, I scolded, for stealing her grace,
And marjoram buds, for they took her tresses;
The roses trembled, each in its own place,
One blushing in shame, another in distresses;
A third, neither red nor white, had thieved from each,
And added your fragrance to its possession.

For stealing such scents, a vengeful canker grew,
Consuming the rosebush, a lesson true.

I observed more blossoms, yet none could escape
The sweetness or color they'd unjustly scraped.

"
99,2,"To the violet, I spoke with disdain:
""Sweet purloiner, whence did you acquire
That fragrance, if not from my love's domain?
The purple tint on your cheek does aspire
To match the blush in my love's tender veins.
You've stained your visage with unrighteous gains.""

The lily, I reproached, for its stolen glee,
And marjoram buds, for they'd taken her hair;
The roses quivered, as if in a ballet,
One red with shame, another pale with care;
A third, devoid of hue, had filched from both,
And added your perfume to its flair.

A vengeful canker, for this theft, arose,
Consuming the rosebush, a dreadful throes.

I noticed other flowers, yet none were free
Of sweetness or color stolen from thee.

"
99,3,"I chided the violet, so sweet and fair:
""Sweet borrower, where did you find your charm,
If not in my love's gentle atmosphere?
The purple blush on your cheek does disarm
My heart, for it echoes my love's own glow;
You've dyed your visage with unlawful spoils.""

The lily, I chastised, for its stolen wiles,
And marjoram buds, for they'd taken her grace;
The roses shivered, as if in denial,
One red with shame, another pale with haste;
A third, without a shade, had filched from each,
And added your scent to its own embrace.

A vengeful canker, for this theft, began
To eat the rosebush; it withered, banned.

I saw more flowers, yet none could elude
The sweetness or color they'd all intruded."
100,1,"Where have you gone, my muse, your voice so still,
Neglecting the source of your grandest strength?
Dissipating energy on frivolous quill,
Obscuring brilliance meant for noblest wreath?
Reawaken, absent-minded muse, and swiftly
Redeem the moments squandered in vain;
In soothing verses, sing to the worthy,
Bestowing talent and reason once again.
Awaken, languid muse; observe anew
My beloved's visage, free from blemish or flaw.
If age has left its mark, let satire ensue,
And render Time's ravages contemptible law.
Grant my love enduring fame, swift and bright,
Outpacing Time's remorseless, fleeting flight.

"
100,2,"Muse, where have you been, so silent and aloof,
Neglecting the wellspring of your power?
Wasting your fury on trifling proof,
Dimming your radiance in the darkest hour?
Return, forgetful muse, and swiftly mend
The wasted hours with gentle, soothing rhyme;
Sing to the ear that cherishes your friend,
And grants your pen both grace and prime.
Awaken, weary muse; behold once more
My beloved's face, untouched by Time's cruel hand.
If age has left its trace, employ satire to explore,
And make Time's thefts a mockery, vast and grand.
Bestow upon my love a fame that thrives,
Overtaking Time's relentless, remorseless jives.

"
100,3,"O Muse, where have you strayed, abandoning so long
The essence of your strength and glory?
Wasting your spirit on unworthy song,
Obscuring your light in the shadows of folly?
Revive, forgetful muse, and swiftly restore
The idle hours with gentle, rhythmic grace;
Sing to the ear that honors your lore,
And lends your quill both art and space.
Awaken, languid muse; observe again
My beloved's face, unmarked by Time's cruel trace.
If age has left its imprint, employ satire's reign,
And render Time's spoils a disgrace, wide and chaste.
Grant my love a fame that swiftly flies,
Outpacing Time's unyielding, remorseless guise."
101,1,"Oh, wandering muse, what debt do you incur
For straying from the path of truth and grace?
Both truth and beauty on my love's face depend,
And so, your duty lies in this embrace.
Speak now, O muse. Will you not perhaps confess,
""Truth needs no mask, for it is beautiful;
Beauty needs no adornment, for it is the best;
When combined, they lose their pure, individual pull?""
Because he needs no flattery, will you stay mute?
Silence is not pardon, for it lies within you
To grant him life beyond a golden crypt,
And praise him through the ages yet to debut.
  Now, perform your duty, muse; I show you how
  To make him live as he does now, even then.

"
101,2,"O vagrant muse, what penance must you pay
For forsaking truth in beauty's sweet guise?
Both truth and beauty on my love's display,
And thus, your purpose, in this union lies.
Answer me, O muse. Might you not rather say,
""Truth needs no gilding, for it shines so bright;
Beauty needs no stage, for it holds the day;
Together, they may blind with their resplendent light?""
Because he seeks no glory, will you be still?
Excuse not silence thus, for it dwells in thee
To make him last past a golden, ornate rill,
And let him be admired by generations yet to see.
  So, fulfill your charge, muse; I guide thee to
  Make him endure when ages gaze anew.

"
101,3,"O errant muse, what reckoning is at hand
For abandoning truth in favor of delight?
Both truth and beauty on my love's command,
And thus, your purpose, in this service, takes its flight.
Tell me, O muse. Could you not possibly assert,
""Truth needs no ornament, for it is enough;
Beauty needs no fanfare, for it's the finest art;
Together, they may overwhelm with their blissful stuff?""
Because he craves no fame, will you then be hushed?
Silence is not absolution, for it dwells in you
To make him linger past a golden, ornate hush,
And let him be commended by the ages yet to ensue.
  Thus, carry out your task, muse; I lead thee through
  A path to make him live, as he does now, anew."
102,1,"Though seeming frail, my affection grows in might,
My ardor does not wane in the dimmed light.
A love proclaimed by all loses its worth,
In silent reverence, true love finds its berth.

In spring's embrace, our love was fresh and new,
I sang its praises, bright as morning dew.
Yet, as summer swells, the nightingale
Ceases her song, lest joy turns stale.

No more the summer night is so sweet,
As countless serenades fill the air,
The once precious tune, now lost in the heat,
Drowned by the cacophony everywhere.

Thus, I too, remain silent at times,
Lest my love's melody loses its rhymes.

"
102,2,"My affection deepens, though it seems to wane,
In love's quiet whispers, I remain.
A love that's boasted is but merchandise,
True sentiment resides in tender sighs.

In spring's soft bloom, our love was born,
Its beauty in my heart was sworn.
Like the nightingale, in summer's glow,
I hushed my voice, as the passion grew.

No more the summer night is so pure,
As countless songs, the silence obscure.
The once cherished tune, now lost in the din,
Of voices raised, where silence once sat in.

Hence, I hold my peace, at times,
To keep our love's sweet, rhythmic rhymes.

"
102,3,"My love is fortified, though it seems to ebb,
Less ostentatious, more heartfelt is myebb.
A love that's flaunted is but shallow coin,
True love's value in quiet moments join.

In spring's sweet breath, our love first blossomed,
Its tendrils curling 'round my soul, encompassed.
Like the nightingale, in summer's zenith,
I ceased my song, as love deepened within it.

No more the summer night is so serene,
As myriad voices, the silence skew.
The once precious song, now lost in the throng,
Of loud professions, where whispers once throng.

Thus, I stay mute, at times,
To safeguard our love's gentle rhymes."
103,1,"Alas, how poor my muse's offerings be,
When such broad canvas lies before her gaze,
The bare idea's worth outshines the plea,
Enhanced by naught but my belated praise.
Oh, chide me not, if now my words are spent!
Gaze in the mirror, there you'll find the source
Of inspiration, dwarfing my intent,
Dimming my words, and leaving me remorse.
Would it not wrong the subject, to amend,
The art that thrives without my humble skill?
My verses but one purpose do intend,
To sing of you, your virtues, and your will.
  Nay, more than ink can hold, your image lives,
  Reflected back, when you to mirror gives.

"
103,2,"Ah, me! What destitution haunts my art,
That, given ample room to spread its wings,
The naked subject steals the lion's part,
And leaves my praises but as tinsel strings.
Spare me your scorn, if now I fail to soar!
Look to the glass, and there behold a face
That leaves my art bereft, and shorn of lore,
O'erwhelmed by beauty's vast, unmatched grace.
Shall I, then, mar the work that wants no aid,
By striving to improve what Nature made?
My verses but one end in view are laid,
To celebrate your worth, in part displayed.
  Yet, still, your mirror shows what words can't hold,
  The boundless beauty, when you look and scold.

"
103,3,"Alas, what meager gifts my muse imparts,
When such grand vistas open at her feet,
The unadorned theme outshines my starts,
And leaves my added praises but as sweet.
Despair not of my verse, if now it flags!
Consult the mirror, and the truth appears,
A countenance that eclipses all my pages,
Dimming my lines, and leaving naught but tears.
Would it not wrong the subject, to amend,
The work that thrives, devoid of mortal aid?
My verses but one aim, in truth, intend,
To laud your virtues, and your graces spread.
  And yet, your glass reveals what words can't say,
  The full-orbed perfection of your face."
104,1,"For thee, dear confidant, time's touch is rare,
In your presence, age and I are estranged.
As in our youth, when first our eyes met there,
Your visage holds the beauty that it gained.
Three winters' chill and summers' blazing heat
Have passed, yet green remains the forest's grace.
Three springs of life have bloomed and then retreated,
Yet three warm autumns failed to mar your face.
Three scents of April in three Junes did wane,
Since first I glimpsed your youth, forever green.
Alas, beauty's touch, like time's unseen hand,
Steals from our sight, unperceived, yet ever swift.
Your charm remains, yet seems to move and shift.

"
104,2,"To my esteemed friend, age holds no claim,
For in your presence, time itself seems lost.
As when we met, your beauty still the same,
No winter's frost nor summer's scorching boast
Can dim your visage or its splendor fade.
Three winters' cold and summers' burning heat
Have passed, yet spring's rebirth and autumn's shade
Retain their verdant hue, as seasons meet.
Three April breezes in three Junes did blow,
Since first I saw your youth, forever so.
Ah, yet the hand of beauty, like a ghost,
Steals from our grasp, unseen, yet ever near.
Your charm remains, and time's illusions clear.

"
104,3,"My revered friend, time's passage marks not thee,
In your embrace, age fades into the night.
As when we met, your beauty shines for me,
Unyielding to the years, both dark and light.
Three winters' chill and summers' ardent fire
Have passed, yet green the forest's boughs remain.
Three springs of life have bloomed, then left in mire,
Three autumns waned, yet left no trace in vain.
Three April blossoms in three Junes did bloom,
Since first I saw your youth, forever bright.
Alas, beauty's touch, like time's unseen hand,
Steals from our sight, unperceived, yet ever swift.
Your charm endures, through time's illusions sift."
105,1,"Let not my affection be labeled idolatry,
Nor my cherished one displayed as a false god,
For my melodies and tributes, equal in purity,
I offer to one soul, steadfast and adored.

My affection is gentle today, tender tomorrow,
In a marvelous consistency it remains;
Thus, my verse, steadfast in its rhythm's flow,
One emotion echoing, shuns superfluous refrains.

""Beautiful, loving, and genuine"" is all my plea,
""Beautiful, loving, and genuine,"" I sing in varying keys;
In this transformation, my creativity finds its decree,
Three notions combined, opening a world of possibilities.

""Beautiful,"" ""loving,"" and ""genuine"" have long been apart,
Now united in harmony, they forever play their part.

"
105,2,"Let not my devotion be named idolatry,
Nor my beloved treated as a hollow symbol,
For my ballads and praises, pure as a crystal sea,
I dedicate to one, unique and perpetual.

My love is tender today, compassionate tomorrow,
In a wondrous constancy, it never wavers;
Thus, my verse, steadfast in its rhythm's throes,
One emotion it sings, shunning empty graves.

""Graceful, caring, and sincere"" is all my plea,
""Graceful, caring, and sincere,"" I compose in shifting hues;
In this metamorphosis, my inspiration takes the lead,
Three aspects combined, opening a universe of views.

""Graceful,"" ""caring,"" and ""sincere"" have danced as separate souls,
Now entwined in harmony, they play their eternal roles.

"
105,3,"Let not my passion be marked as idolatry,
Nor my beloved seen as a deceptive icon,
For my odes and praises, clear as a mountain spring,
I pen for one, genuine and never gone.

My love is warm today, affectionate tomorrow,
In a marvelous constancy, it never fades;
Thus, my verse, steadfast in its rhythm's flow,
One sentiment it voices, unburdened by clichés.

""Charming, loving, and true"" is all my claim,
""Charming, loving, and true,"" I express in diverse ways;
In this evolution, my artistry takes the reins,
Three facets combined, opening a realm of new phases.

""Charming,"" ""loving,"" and ""true"" have soared in different skies,
Now united in harmony, they forever rise."
106,1,"In the annals of squandered moments past,
I find accounts of those whose beauty graced,
And verses penned in praise of love that lasted,
Of noble hearts and visages chaste.
Within ancient lauds of elegance rare,
Of form, of gait, of smile, of gaze, of brow,
I perceive their quills would have likened fair
A beauty such as now you wear somehow.
Thus all their praises serve as oracles,
Of this our age, all pointing to you;
And for they saw with prescient sight that tolls,
Their words fell short in capturing truth of you.
  For we who dwell in this resplendent now,
  Have eyes to marvel, but voices that fail to endow.

"
106,2,"Within the record of time misspent,
I see depictions of the fairest beings,
And ancient verse extolling love lament,
Of gallant knights and lovely dreamings.
In the heraldry of beauty's finest hour,
Of touch, of step, of whisper, of sight,
I sense their words could summon such power,
To paint a visage such as thine in light.
So all their praises prove but shadows cast,
Of this our time, all heralding thee;
And for they glimpsed through veils of past unfast,
Their songs fell short in capturing thee.
  For we who stand in this enlightened age,
  Have eyes to see, but voices that turn pale with age.

"
106,3,"Within the annals of time ill-spent,
I find portraits of the loveliest of beings,
And ancient verse that love's sweet sorrow lent,
Of chivalrous knights and lovely visions.
In the blazonry of beauty's zenith high,
Of skin, of stride, of murmur, of glance,
I observe their quills could amplify,
A visage such as thine in subtle dance.
So all their praises whisper echoes,
Of this our age, all foretelling thee;
And for they peered through veils of past shadows,
Their voices wavered, lacking clarity.
  For we who inhabit this radiant now,
  Have eyes to witness, but voices that hesitate to allow."
107,1,"Away, my qualms and seers' visions of dread,
World's vast canvas of future events,
Cannot shackle my true love's time, I've said,
Imagined lost to a fate unbending.
The lunar eclipse, the world's weeping done,
Augurs' despair now mocks their darkest fears;
Uncertainties now don the cloak of ""done,""
And tranquility its olive wreath wears.
Now, bathed in this season's gentle rain,
My love blooms, and Death concedes my right,
For in these lines, though shadows may remain,
I'll thrive, outlasting tyrants' final night.
  Here, in this verse, your tribute shall endure,
  When all their monuments of brass are pure.

"
107,2,"My own apprehensions nor the wide world's,
Dreaming of what the future may unfold,
Can steal my true love's time, as I assert,
Believed to be confined by doom's hold.
The lunar shadow's reign has passed away,
And soothsayers' tears now mock their direst cries;
Doubts now are crowned with certainty's array,
And calmness brings its endless olive skies.
Now, bathed in this season's sweetest dew,
My love rejuvenates, and Death concedes,
For through these lines, though shadows may ensue,
I'll persevere, outlasting those who fled.
  In this humble verse, your testament lives,
  When tyrants' names and bronze-bound tombs forgive.

"
107,3,"No longer bound by my own qualms or sight,
Of the vast world's dreams foretelling the morrow,
Can seize my true love's time, I claim,
Lost to a future, unyielding, narrow.
The moon has seen her darkest night conclude,
And prophets' sorrow now belies their dread;
Uncertainty has claimed its crown, unbound,
And peace proclaims its endless olive spread.
Now, bathed in this season's gentlest rain,
My love flourishes, and Death bows to me,
For through these lines, though shadows may remain,
I'll endure, outlasting tyrants' decree.
  Here, in this poem, your legacy's laid,
  When conquerors' names and monuments fade."
108,1,"What hidden depths within the mind reside,
That ink might capture and to you convey
My genuine essence, spirit ever-tide,
A fresh expression of our love each day?

Yet still I speak anew, as prayers divine,
Of thee, my love, each day and every night,
For every word feels like the very first,
An affirmation of our boundless might.

So too does love's eternal flame endure,
Unfazed by time, that thief of fleeting years,
In its embrace, no wrinkles shall obscure,
The truth that lies in love, in spite of tears.

In love's own book, the pages ever-turn,
A testament to passions yet to learn.

"
108,2,"What mysteries within the heart remain,
That words might paint, and thus bring thee to see,
The depths of love, in joy and in its pain,
A mirror of our bond, for all to be?

In ink, I trace the lines of love's own face,
A portrait of the soul, in verses bright,
Each word a tender touch, a gentle grace,
That binds us close, two hearts entwined in light.

And though the years may leave their mark upon,
Our bodies, love's eternal fire burns,
Unyielding, undiminished, ever spun,
From the first days when our love first turned.

In love's own tale, the chapters ever-write,
A chronicle of passion's endless flight.

"
108,3,"What secrets of the heart might ink reveal,
That echo still the truth of love's own song?
In every line, I seek to make it real,
A testament to where we both belong.

Within words, I find a refuge, a space,
To share the love that fills me, day by day,
Each phrase a whisper, each verse holds its place,
A symphony of feelings, come what may.

And as the years pass by, and time takes hold,
Our love remains steadfast, constant, and true,
No shadow cast by age or story told,
Can dim the flame that burns for me and you.

In love's own story, the narrative weaves,
A tapestry of dreams, and love that grieves."
109,1,"Ah, ne'er declare my heart was untrue,
Though distance may have dimmed my ardor's light;
From myself, I could no more part,
Than from my soul, hidden in your sight.
If I have strayed, like wanderer I roam,
Returning to the selfsame spot,
In time, not bound by fleeting moment,
Bringing my own redemption's potion I have sought.
Believe not, though my nature harbored flaws,
That it could ever be so tainted,
To forsake all virtues in your cause,
In this vast cosmos, only you are painted.
For naught in this grand universe I see,
But you, my rose; in you, my harmony."
110,1,"Indeed, I've wandered far and wide,
Presenting a spectacle, far and wide,
Wounded my own thoughts, cheaply sold the priceless,
Transformed past affections into present transgressions.

True, I've glanced at truth askance,
But by all that's holy, my stumbles granted me
A second youth, my worst attempts revealed
My deepest love for thee.

Now, all is said and done, take what will last forever.
My desires I'll never more force to prove,
To test a newer bond with an older friend,
A divine love, in which I find my end.

Welcome me, then, as the best gift next to heaven,
To your purest heart, where my soul is driven.

"
110,2,"In truth, I've roamed and changed in hue,
Betrayed my thoughts, traded treasures for trifles,
Made ancient wounds from fresh affections anew.
Indeed, I've viewed truth with jaded eyes.

Yet, by all that's sacred, my missteps
Revived my heart, my failures proved
My truest love for you, and so,
Embrace me, for I am forever yours.

No more will I feed my hunger for proof,
To test a newer bond with an older friend,
A god in love, who holds me close.

Welcome me, then, as heaven's second best,
To your loving heart, my eternal rest.

"
110,3,"Indeed, I've journeyed near and far,
Displayed a puzzling sight to all,
Wounded my own mind, traded gold for dross,
Made past mistakes of present feelings.

True, I've seen truth with suspicion's eyes,
But by all that's sacred, my blunders
Revealed a second youth, my failures
Proved my deepest love for you.

Now, all is finished, keep what's everlasting.
My longing I'll never more force to test,
To try a newer bond with an older friend,
A god in love, who binds me close.

Welcome me, then, as the best gift next to bliss,
To your sacred heart, my heart's abyss."
111,1,"Oh, do you reproach Fortuna on my behalf,
That cruel mistress, source of all my strife,
Who granted not a life exempt from grief,
But public station, breeding ground of ill.
Thus is my name now marred, my essence dyed
By the very work my hands engage,
As the dyer's hand takes on the hue it makes.
Have mercy, then, and wish for my new birth,
As I, obedient patient, swallow down
The bitter remedies for my ill health.
No pain nor punishment I'll deem too harsh,
If only they may cleanse my soul at last.
Pity me, then, dear friend, and know this truth:
Your compassion alone can bring me proof.

"
111,2,"O forlorn, do you upbraid the fate I've known,
That capricious goddess of my woe,
Who granted not a life serene and shown,
But left me in the public eye to grow.
My name, then, bears a mark of disgrace,
And near so, my heart bends to its will,
Like the dyer's hand, dyed by its own embrace.
Show me pity, friend, and wish me well,
As I drink down the cure for my own plight,
No matter how bitter the taste may be.
I'll bear the pain, the punishment, the fight,
If it brings me to a purified sea.
Pity me, then, and I'll tell you this:
Your pity alone can grant me my bliss.

"
111,3,"Oh, do you scold the stars, my tragic lot,
That wretched force behind my bitter days,
Who granted not a life unsullied, sought,
But cast me forth in public's blinding gaze.
My name, then, bears a stigma, and near,
My heart conforms to its commanding grip,
Like the dyer's hand, dyed by its own career.
Take pity, friend, and wish me a fresh start,
As I swallow the remedy for my pain,
No matter how harsh the flavor may seem.
I'll bear the bitterness, the double strain,
If it can bring me to a purer realm.
Pity me, then, and know this verity:
Your pity's power can heal my injury."
112,1,"The imprint of reproach upon my brow,
A coarse disgrace etched by common tongues,
Fades in your love, as kindest rains bestow
New life on parched earth where no flowers sprung.
You are my sun, my moon, my guiding star,
The compass that my drifting heart relies;
No other voice or judgment matters far,
When set against your wisdom, your sage advice.
I cast away all thoughts of praise or scorn,
And let my heart to yours in harmony dance;
The serpent's bite of criticism, torn,
No longer poisons this unguarded romance.
  For in your purpose, I am firmly rooted,
  And all the world beside is but diluted.

"
112,2,"The brand of scorn, upon my visage seared,
By popular spite and censure's sting,
Dissolves within your love, as gentle tears
Bestow their solace on my spirit's wing.
You are my universe, my guiding light,
The lodestar that my soul navigates;
No other voice or judgment holds such might,
When weighed against your own, so full of grace.
I cast away all thoughts of praise or blame,
And let my heart to yours in harmony sway;
The venom's grip of criticism, tamed,
No longer poisons this enraptured ballet.
  For in your purpose, I am truly grounded,
  And all the world beside is but confounded.

"
112,3,"The mark of shame, upon my soul ingrained,
By public scorn and slander's cruel blow,
Dissipates within your love, as tender rain
Revives the wilted blossoms in the vale below.
You are my earth, my sky, my endless sea,
The compass that my wandering heart pursues;
No other voice or judgment holds the key,
When set against your own, so brimming with news.
I cast away all thoughts of accolade or blame,
And let my heart to yours in harmony soar;
The poison's hold of criticism, feigned,
No longer poisons this exultant lore.
  For in your purpose, I am truly centered,
  And all the world beside is but disjointed."
113,1,"Ever since our farewell, my sight's confined,
Within the chambers of my thoughts, it roams;
The force that guides my steps, now partially blind,
Feigns vision, while its essence leaves its home.
No scene or figure can the mind perceive,
Without your image interposed between,
In every object, 'tis you I conceive,
Your form distilled from all that I have seen.
Whether it's the lowliest or noblest creature,
The plainest sight or grandest spectacle,
My mind, ensnared by love, can only measure
The world through the lens of our connection's spell.
  In this enchantment lies my heart's deceit,
  For in your image, every truth I meet.

"
113,2,"Departed from your side, my gaze is led,
By visions of you, in my mind they dance;
The power controlling me is half-blind,
As if sightless, yet feigning a trance.
My eye may wander, yet it cannot stray,
From the imprint of you that it bears,
For every form I see, in some way,
Is but a mirror reflecting your cares.
The humblest bloom or the most regal beast,
The darkest night or the brightest day,
All bear your semblance, none can ever cease,
To whisper your name in their subtle way.
  My mind, ensnared by your eternal grace,
  Transforms each sight, in your image to trace.

"
113,3,"From the moment we parted, my vision's bound,
Within the fortress of thought, it resides,
The guiding force that propels me, is now unsteady,
As if sightless, while feigning to guide.
My eye may wander, yet never truly sees,
The world beyond the veil of your memory,
For every shape and form, in its decrees,
Is but a shadow of our shared history.
The simplest bird or the grandest tree,
The darkest abyss or the brightest sky,
All echo your presence, a symphony,
Of love's refrain, that will never die.
  My mind, enthralled by your eternal flame,
  Transforms each scene, to bear your cherished name."
114,1,"Investigating if my mind, adorned by thee,
Partakes in royal praise, such venom deep?
Or if my sight, in truth, doth testify,
That love hath taught it to reshape and seep,
Into the vile, a heavenly grace to cast,
A beauty like your own, from dross to rise,
In every dark, a brilliance to outlast,
As shadows flee before the sun's surprise.
Alas, it is the former: flattery's grip,
In my great thoughts, the sovereign poison sips.
My eye, aware, readies the deadly sip,
A lesser vice, if love such venom clips.
  So, if it be tainted, 'tis no great crime,
  For love initiates the first step in time.

"
114,2,"Delving into if my mind, enraptured by your reign,
Succumbs to adulation's toxic strain?
Or if my gaze, in verity, shall confess,
That love hath trained it to refashion dress,
The hideous into angels, fair to view,
Resembling you, my dearest, ever true,
Transforming ill to good, as if anew,
As forms align before love's radiant cue.
Ah, verily, it is the former: flattery's sway,
In my vast mind, the monarch's bane doth lay.
My eye, well knowing, readies the deceit,
A venial error, should love lead defeat.
  If poisoned, 'tis no grave transgression,
  For love directs the first impression's progression.

"
114,3,"Exploring if my mind, ensnared by your allure,
Gives audience to flattery, false and impure?
Or if my vision, honest and sincere,
Reports that love hath shaped its crystal clear,
To see monstrosities transformed to grace,
A mirror of your visage, sweet embrace,
In every blot, a star to trace,
As darkness fades before the dawn's embrace.
Indeed, it is the former: flattery's feast,
In my grand mind, the sovereign's bane increased.
My eye, informed, anticipates the brew,
A minor fault, if love the poison strew.
  If tainted, 'tis no grave misgiving,
  For love commands the first impression's living."
115,1,"The words I penned, now proven to be false,
Even those that swore my love for you could not increase;
For in that moment, wisdom held no hold,
My passion's zenith remained beyond reach, a tease.
Yet, as the sands of time relentlessly flow,
Their myriad of chances and events interfere,
Fading beauty, dulling the keenest of desires,
Guiding great minds to the path of change they fear.
Oh, why then, fearful of time's unyielding reign,
Did I not declare, ""Now I love you most,""
When certainty reigned over doubt,
Exalting the present, doubting the unborn ghost?
  For love is ever growing, then might I not claim,
  To nurture its tender shoot towards eternal flame.

"
115,2,"The verses I once inscribed, alas, deceive,
Even those that pledged my love for you transcending;
In that hour, discernment had no place,
My affection's zenith, yet unseen, left pending.
Consider the march of time, with countless shifts,
That weaves between promises and monarchs' decrees,
Fading beauty, blunting the sharpest of resolves,
Turning steadfast minds to the call of change with ease.
Ah, thus, why fearing time's unyielding grip,
Did I not then declare, ""Now I love you best,""
When certainty held sway over doubt,
Crowning the instant, doubting the unborn quest?
  Love is a journey, then might I not assert,
  To foster its course towards the purest cert.

"
115,3,"The stanzas I once crafted, turn out to fib,
Even those that attested my love for you unequaled;
In that instance, foresight had no reign,
My devotion's pinnacle, unseen, left unscaled.
Ponder the tide of time, with myriad ebbs,
That seeps between oaths and rulers' shifting seals,
Fading beauty, blunting the sharpest of yearnings,
Turning resolute minds to the pull of change they feel.
Alas, why, fearing time's unyielding hand,
Did I not then assert, ""Now I love you most,""
When certainty held dominion over doubt,
Crowning the moment, doubting the unborn boast?
  Love is a voyage, then might I not profess,
  To steer its path towards the truest zenith's address."
116,1,"In true hearts' union, let no hindrance dwell,
For love that wavers with the tides of change
Is not the love where genuine souls dwell,
Unyielding, constant through life's vast range.
A beacon steadfast in the storm's embrace,
Unfaltering, guiding every heart that roams,
Love's value hidden, though its heights we trace,
Unmoved by Time's relentless scythe that homes.
Though fleeting are the blush of lips and glow of cheeks,
Love's constancy remains, undaunted, strong,
Resisting Time's brief assaults and weeks,
Enduring to the very edge of wrong.
   If this be false, and I am proved untrue,
   No words were penned, nor love by mortals knew.

"
116,2,"To true minds' harmonious union, grant no wall,
For love that bends to circumstance is flawed,
An ever-changing force, it will surely fall,
And from its grip, the faithful will withdraw.
A fixed star, love gazes upon the tempests,
Unyielding, constant, never shaken by the gales,
A guiding light for every soul that wanders restless,
Its worth unknown, though we its height assail.
Love mocks at Time, untouched by rosy lips and cheeks
Within his fleeting grasp, for love stays true,
Unaltered by Time's swift and transient weeks,
Persisting through life's myriad hues and shrewd.
   If this be error, and my heart is false,
   No words were writ, and love was never lost.

"
116,3,"In unity of true minds, allow no separation,
For love that bends to change is but a shell,
An unstable force, devoid of constancy,
And from its grasp, hearts will surely fell.
A steadfast beacon in the heart's vast ocean,
Unwavering, enduring, through tempests unbroken,
A guiding star for every soul in motion,
Its worth unknown, though we its height have spoken.
Love laughs at Time, unfazed by rosy lips and cheeks
Within his swift and fleeting compass cast,
For love remains, steadfast, through life's transient weeks,
Persisting through life's myriad joys and past.
   If this be false, and I am proved untrue,
   No words were penned, and love was never knew."
117,1,"You reproach me rightly, for I have been
Unmindful of your worth, your love's great cost;
Neglected to give voice to words unseen
That bind me to you, day by day, and lost.
I've wandered among strangers' minds, unfurled
My sails to every wind, away from you;
My willful heart and errors swirled, twirled,
In directions leading me from sight of you.
Inscribe my disobedience and my faults,
Accumulate your grievances and aim;
Within your censure's shadow, I've been caught,
Yet do not let your anger bring you shame.
  My plea maintains that I have sought to show
  The steadfastness and virtue in your love.

"
117,2,"Chide me, for I have fallen short in all
That I should render, to repay your love,
Forgot to honor what binds us all,
To cherish dear the ties you've woven, above.
I've strayed among the throng of unknown minds,
And squandered time, your dearest treasure earned;
My heart has followed every shifting wind,
Adrift, and far from where your love was sworn.
Enumerate my stubbornness and blunders,
Collect your grievances, and bring them near;
Within your sternest gaze, I now surrender,
But do not let your ire obscure your cheer.
  My case insists that I have tried to demonstrate
  The loyalty and virtue in your fate.

"
117,3,"Rebuke me justly, for I have withheld
The reverence due, the tribute of my love;
Forgot to celebrate the sacred bond
That binds us day by day, and proves us tried and true.
I've wandered off with strangers' minds, unmoored,
My sails unfurled to every gusting breeze;
My willful heart and errors have explored
A path that led me far from your sweet ease.
Record my disobedience and my errors,
Accumulate your grievances and aim;
Within your disapproval, I now enter,
But do not let your anger bring you shame.
  My plea contends that I have sought to prove
  The faithfulness and virtue of your love."
118,1,"To sharpen our desire with zest anew
With piquant blends, our palate we entice;
To thwart unseen ailments, we bid adieu
To wellness, purging to avoid vice;
In joy's fullness, I embraced bitterness,
Forgetting sweetness, seeking discomfort;
In love's strange policy, I found distress,
A sickness borne before true illness came.
In love, to fend off ills not there, I erred,
And medicine's cure, I found, was but a name;
Yet, from this fall, I learned and understood:
Your ""cure"" is poison, causing pain and shame.

"
118,2,"To heighten our hunger, seasonings we add,
To stave off hidden ills, we sickness chase;
With eager compounds, our palate is glad,
Yet, in the process, we grow weak and lace.
My heart, once full of your unmatched delight,
Sought out the bitter, forsaking the sweet;
In love's strange plight, I found a taste for spite,
A hunger born before true hunger beat.
In love's odd ways, I sought to forestall,
And found that health, once lost, could not be regained;
Yet, from this fall, I learned and understood:
Your ""remedy"" brought sickness in its train.

"
118,3,"To make our longing hunger for the feast,
We mix our flavors, seeking sharp delight;
To keep our secret pains at bay, we greet
The bitterness that banishes our plight.
My heart, once full of your unmatched embrace,
Grew weary of the sweet, and sought the sour;
In love's odd grace, I found a bitter taste,
A hunger born before true hunger's hour.
In love's strange wisdom, I sought to forestall,
And found that health, once lost, could not be claimed;
Yet, from this fall, I learned and understood:
Your ""cure"" brought sickness, breaking love's sweet chain."
119,1,"Which elixirs of sorrow have I tasted,
Brewed in cauldrons of despair and woe,
Where joy turns to ashes, and hope is chasted,
In the pursuit of dreams that I can't forgo?
What bitter lessons has my heart endured,
Believing itself forever blessed?
How have my eyes been torn from their course,
In the chaos of this ceaseless unrest?
Oh, wisdom of misfortune! Now I see
That hardship is the forge where strength is made;
And love, when broken and then reborn,
Shines brighter than before, more tried, and unafraid.
  Thus, I return, chastened but not defeated,
  And find that loss has lessons yet repeated.

"
119,2,"What draughts of anguish have I quaffed before,
Brewed in cauldrons of remorse and regret?
My heart, once filled with hope, is at its core
Now marred by errors I can't forget.
My eyes, once clear, have strayed from their right path,
In the turmoil of this ever-present strife.
Oh, cruel revelation of my past,
That taught me how to navigate through life!
For suffering is the fire that refines,
And love, when lost and then regained,
Is purified, made stronger than before,
With depth and wisdom that can't be feigned.
  So I return, enlightened and aware,
  That every trial leaves me stronger, if I dare.

"
119,3,"What concoctions of despair have I swallowed,
Brewed in vessels of despair and fear?
My heart, once filled with hope, has followed
The siren call of sorrow and despair.
My eyes, once bright, have lost their way,
In the tumult of this endless night.
Oh, bitter lesson of my disarray,
That taught me how to find the light!
For hardship is the sculptor that reveals,
And love, when shattered and then rebuilt,
Is tempered, made more resilient than before,
With scars that tell a story of resilience and worth.
  So I return, transformed and renewed,
  With every challenge, my resolve is glued."
120,1,"Once you were harsh, now friendship's grace imbues,
And for the grief I felt in days of yore,
My heart bows low beneath the weight it chose,
Unless it turned to iron or was something more.
For if your heart was moved by my unkindness,
As mine by yours, you've tasted deep despair,
And I, a cruel master, showed no kindness,
Neglecting to atone for my share of care.
Oh, that our darkest hours could have recalled
The depth of pain true sorrow can bestow,
And swiftly moved us to each other's aid,
Applying balm where wounds of heart do grow.
  Yet now your error pays my debt in full;
  My guilt is paid by yours, and yours by me.

"
120,2,"In times gone by, your harshness was my bane,
Yet now that memory serves to soothe my soul,
For if I bow to past transgressions' pain,
My spirit finds its strength in love's sweet role.
If you were hurt by my unkindness too,
Then you have known a torment dark and deep,
And I, a tormentor, failed to see it through,
To feel the weight of guilt my actions reap.
Oh, that our shared affliction could have taught
A lesson learned in suffering's bitter school,
That soon we'd turn to heal each other's hearts,
With gentle hands and words that make us whole.
  But now your wrong has paid my dues in full;
  My redemption comes through your atonement's pull.

"
120,3,"The memory of your past unkindness stirs
A strange contentment in my heart today,
For if I bend beneath the load of words
That caused you pain, I find a better way.
If you were touched by my unkindness so,
As I by yours, you've worn a heavy crown,
And I, a heartless king, did not forego
The chance to lift your burden from the ground.
Oh, that our mutual woe could have revealed
The truth of hurt concealed within our breast,
And swiftly led us to each other's side,
To share the solace only love knows best.
  Yet now your error pays my debt in part;
  My guilt is eased by your reparation's art."
121,1,"To be reviled or vile in reputation,
What difference lies in the world's jaundiced view?
When innocence brings accusation,
The joy of right is lost, and that we rue.
Why heed the blind eyes of the prejudiced,
Counting sin where I perceive virtue's face?
Or spy their failings, masked by self-defense,
Projecting flaws upon my given grace?
No, I remain as I am, true and steadfast,
While they, distorted, judge me through their haze.
Though they may bend, I stand, and that's the last,
Unless this universal corruption blaze:
  All hearts are marred, and thus their rule is done,
  In darkness, they believe their evil's spun.

"
121,2,"Better to be base and named as such,
Than suffer scorn when innocence is shown.
For when we lose the pleasure we clutch,
'Tis not by our hearts but by others' loathe thrown.
Why should our deeds be judged by their sight,
Their twisted vision marring truth so bright?
Or on our faults do they, with narrow minds,
Project their shadows, blemishing our light?
I am as I am, and they, in their spite,
Measure our worth by their own fallow ground.
Though they may stray, I hold the path upright,
Unless this wickedness in all is found:
  All souls are tainted, and thus they condemn,
  In darkness, they mistake light for their gloom.

"
121,3,"Rather to be loathed than held in scorn,
When pure intent is met with false surmise.
The joy of righteousness, once torn,
Leaves bitterness in its wake, to our surprise.
Why should our names suffer at their hands,
Judging our worth by their own biased stands?
Or on our errors, magnified by fear,
Do they project their own uncertainties?
I am as I am, and they, in their ire,
Judge us by their own corrupted scale.
Though they may falter, we shall not tire,
Unless this universal guilt unveil:
  All lives are flawed, and thus they cast us down,
  In darkness, they mistake virtue for their blemish's crown."
122,1,"Your gift, etched within my memory's page,
In living characters of lasting worth,
Shall hold a rank above life's fleeting stage,
Outliving mortal bounds and earthly birth.
As long as heart and mind in me reside,
Your image, like a cherished treasure kept,
In my remembrance, it shall not subside,
Nor to oblivion's gulf be ever swept.
No need for mundane tokens do I crave,
For in my thoughts, your essence shall remain,
And to discard such trifles I am brave,
Entrusting memory to hold you dear.
  To bear a keepsake of you I despise,
  For in my mind, your memory never dies.

"
122,2,"Your gift, inscribed within my heart's own book,
With characters of everlasting hue,
Shall claim a station far above mere look,
Defying time and change, forever new.
As long as blood through veins of life shall flow,
Your memory, like a precious gem, shall stay,
Undimmed by years, and untouched by woe,
A beacon burning bright, come night or day.
No need for mementos do I seek,
For in my mind, your presence shall abide,
And thus, I boldly cast aside the weak,
Frail tokens of your love, and confide,
  In my heart's faithful record, to preserve
  The love you gave, and all it represents.

"
122,3,"Your gift, engraved upon my soul's own scroll,
In indelible ink, of lasting might,
Shall claim a place above life's ebb and flow,
Immune to time, and hidden from its sight.
As long as breath and spirit in me dwell,
Your memory, like a sacred shrine, shall stand,
Unmoved by sorrow, and unfazed by swell,
A fortress strong, on life's uncertain sand.
No need for symbols do I long require,
For in my thoughts, your spirit shall endure,
And so, I cast away with ardor's fire,
The earthly ties that once I did ensure,
  In my soul's vast archive, your love I'll keep,
  A testament to all you gave, and more."
123,1,"No, Time, you'll not claim victory in change from me.
Your towering structures, erected with renewed force,
To my experienced eyes, they hold no mystery.
In your fleeting moments, we find solace, of course.

We cherish what you recycle, label it ""new,""
When in reality, it's just a repackaged tale,
A story worn and weathered, yet we're drawn to it,
Enamored by its charm, unable to fail.

Your logs and chronicles, I dismiss with ease,
Unmoved by the transient and the bygone past,
For your accounts and sights are deceptive,
A mere construct of your unending haste.

I vow to stay steadfast, unwavering in loyalty,
Unyielding to your scythe, Time, I'll maintain my dignity.

"
123,2,"No, Time, you won't boast that I have altered my course.
Your monuments, rising with fresh determination,
To me, bear no novelty, no deviation,
But echoes of the past, a former induction.

Our fleeting rendezvous, we cherish and hold,
In awe of the old, we weave it in our stories untold.
We breathe life into your relics, make them our own,
In the tapestry of time, they brightly glow.

Your records and chronicles, I disregard,
Unmoved by the present or the days long past.
For your accounts and sights are but a mirage,
A shifting illusion, a transient blast.

I vow to stay constant, unbroken in my oath,
Defiant to your scythe, Time, I'll remain aloof.

"
123,3,"No, Time, you'll not gloat that I have changed my ways.
Your monoliths, built with revived ambition,
To me, they're but remnants, a former phase,
A repetition of history's narration.

Our brief encounters, we treasure and adore,
In the guise of the past, we find solace galore.
We embellish your remnants, make them anew,
In the fabric of time, they shine and endure.

Your logs and chronicles, I cast aside,
Unmoved by the transient or the days long past.
For your records and sights are but a façade,
A fleeting shadow, a moment surpassed.

I vow to stay resilient, steadfast in my pledge,
Unyielding to your scythe, Time, I'll stand my ground."
124,1,"Had my cherished affection sprung from worldly rank,
It might have been cast off, abandoned by its sire,
At mercy of fortune's fleeting, capricious tantrum,
A weed among weeds, or a flower in desire's fire.

Nay, 'twas raised far from the reach of random chance,
Unyielding to the allure of false, ephemeral glory,
Nor does it bow to the disgruntled, chained complaints,
Or bend beneath the hammering blows of hollow glory.

It fears not the whims of power-hungry heretics,
Who peddle influence in the marketplace of hours,
But stands alone, its wisdom vast and colossal,
Impervious to the whims of sun or torrent showers.

I bear witness to this truth, and so should you,
For fools of time have died for virtue, living in deceit.

"
124,2,"Were my beloved a creature of high estate,
It could be left an orphan, abandoned by its fate,
At the whim of fortune's child, loved or disdained,
A weed among weeds, or a flower in fortune's gate.

No, it was formed in a realm far removed from chaos,
Unaffected by the smiles of hollow pomp and pride,
Nor does it falter under the weight of discontent,
Or crumble when the fashion of time is our guide.

It fears not the wiles of the heretic policy,
Which thrives on the brief span of our mortal hours,
But stands alone, its wisdom vast and mighty,
Unyielding to the sun's scorch or the storm's darkest showers.

To this I testify, and so should you,
For fools of time have died for virtue, living in deceit.

"
124,3,"If my dearest love were born of worldly power,
It might be left bereft, abandoned by its hour,
At the mercy of fortune's ever-changing whims,
A weed among weeds, or a flower in the sunlit primrose.

Nay, 'twas conceived in a place far from the madding crowd,
Unyielding to the allure of false, fleeting glory,
Nor does it bow to the disgruntled, chained complaints,
Or bend beneath the hammering blows of hollow glory.

It fears not the schemes of the heretic policy,
Which thrives on the brief span of our mortal hours,
But stands alone, its wisdom vast and unyielding,
Impervious to the sun's scorch or the storm's darkest showers.

I bear witness to this truth, and so should you,
For fools of time have died for virtue, living in deceit."
125,1,"If I held aloft the canopy,
In external reverence outward showing,
Or laid the groundwork for eternity,
That crumbles soon as built, doomed to falling?
Have I not witnessed those who chase renown,
And in the pursuit of form and flattery,
Lose all they have, and more, in excess thrown
Away on hollow dreams of false grandeur?
No, let me serve with genuine devotion,
My humble gift, pure heart, and true affection,
Unmixed with schemes or hidden potion,
A simple act of love, without pretension.
  Thus, thou manipulative betrayer; a true spirit
  Stands firm and proud, even amidst accusation.

"
125,2,"What if I held the canopy on high,
With outward show of respect and homage,
Or laid the cornerstone for time gone by,
That proves more fleeting than decay or damage?
Have I not seen those captivated by fame,
And in their quest for admiration, squander
All they possess, and more, in fortune's game,
Exchanging genuine joy for shallow glamour?
No, let me serve with sincerity,
My humble offer, poor but heartfelt,
Without pretense or hidden mystery,
A genuine bond, for us, mutually built.
  So, thou deceitful accuser; a true soul
  Remains unbroken, even as it's put to the test.

"
125,3,"If I had held the canopy in place,
With formal gestures granting false adoration,
Or built the foundation for a distant space,
That fades like vapor, lost to time's desolation?
Have I not seen those chasing popularity,
And in their thirst for recognition, lose
All they have, and more, in vanity,
Their dreams of glory swiftly to abuse?
No, let me serve with genuine loyalty,
My humble tribute, poor but true,
Without disguise or hidden royalty,
A simple gift, from me to you.
  Thus, thou cunning slanderer; a true heart
  Shines brightest when beset by darkest art."
126,1,"O, to you, my cherished youth, you clutching
The fleeting hour-glass of mutable Time,
Your tender bloom receding, love anew hatching,
In your waning, mirrors my decline.
If Nature, reigning queen over decay,
As you advance, persists in stealing you away,
She binds you to this end, her artistry
Intended to shame Time's cruel decree.
Beware, my delight, of her seductive lure!
She can only detain, not eternally ensure.
Her reckoning, though postponed, must come to pass,
And her acquittal lies in releasing you at last.

"
126,2,"To thee, my radiant lad, wielder of Time's hourglass,
Whose waxing glow reveals my own decay,
Thou, in thy fading, dost illuminate
The withering of love, as blossoms fall away.
Should Nature, reigning sovereign, deign to keep
Your beauty ever near, her debt to reap,
She'll show her mastery, and Time disgrace,
By halting Time's relentless, ruthless pace.
Take heed, my darling, of her treacherous allure!
She keeps you close, but not forever secure.
Her final tally, though delayed, must be paid,
And her recompense is to let you fade.

"
126,3,"For you, my fair-haired child, commander of moments,
Whose tender age reveals my own advancement,
In your decline, love's ephemeral nature shows,
As petals fall, and wilted hopes ebb and flow.
If Nature, reigning empress, keeps you near,
Her dominion over Time grows ever clear,
Her artistry displayed, Time's march disgraced,
And fleeting moments cease to be so chased.
Beware, my joy, of her enticing sway!
She'll hold you close, but not forever stay.
Her reckoning, though deferred, must find its way,
And her release is to let you slip away."
127,1,"In twilight's reign, black hue was ne'er admired,
Or if it were, it held not beauty's grace;
Now black, as heir to beauty, is aspired,
And beauty tainted by a false embrace.
As every person wields the artist's hand,
Adorning ugliness with false allure,
Sweet beauty finds no name, no sacred land,
Profaned, or dwells in ignominy's lure.
My dark-eyed maiden, thus, inherits woe,
Her gaze so fitting, like mourners they seem,
At those who, not begotten fair, bestow
False beauty's crown on an unworthy dream.
In sorrow's guise, they weep, and rightly so,
For every voice now cries: thus should beauty glow.

"
127,2,"In autumn's dusk, black was never praised,
Or if it were, it failed to claim the name;
Now black, as beauty's heir, is widely hailed,
And beauty smeared by false and fleeting fame.
As every heart embraces nature's art,
Embellishing the plain with false delight,
Sweet beauty finds no sanctuary, no start,
Defamed, or dwells within the shadows' blight.
My dame of darkened orbs, she bears her plight,
Her gaze so solemn, as if in mourning dress,
At those who, not endowed with beauty's light,
Adorn themselves with false and hollow finesse.
In sorrow's guise, they grieve, and rightly so,
For every voice now whispers: thus should beauty glow.

"
127,3,"In evening's hue, black was never prized,
Or if it were, it held not beauty's crown;
Now black, as beauty's heir, is much admired,
And beauty tarnished by a false renown.
As every soul adopts the artist's touch,
Adorning ugliness with false adorn,
Sweet beauty finds no shrine, no gentle clutch,
Defamed, or dwells in twilight's scorn.
My lady of the darkened sphere, she bears her pain,
Her gaze so somber, like mourners in a dream,
At those who, not begotten fair, obtain
False beauty's grace by a deceitful scheme.
In sorrow's guise, they weep, and rightly so,
For every tongue now murmurs: thus should beauty glow."
128,1,"How often, when you, my melody, play
Your music on that sacred wooden stage,
As deftly your nimble fingers sway,
And coax from strings a symphony's gauge;
I watch those pegs that swiftly leap and dance,
To touch the heart of your enchanting hand.
My lips, which long to gather your romance,
At their own boldness, by you are withheld.
To be caressed as those inanimate pieces,
I'd trade my place, and with them become one,
Beneath your touch, their wooden lives increase,
More blessed than the breath from my own lungs.
Since these inanimate objects find such joy,
Grant them your touch, and to me, your lips' allure.

"
128,2,"How frequently, when you, my muse, create
Your music on that hallowed wooden box,
With practiced hands, you skillfully navigate
The strings that vibrate as your fingers lock.
I watch those bridges that so willingly
Respond to your caress, and touch your skin.
My lips, which crave to drink your harmony,
At their own daring, by you are left forlorn.
To be embraced as those unfeeling slats,
I'd trade my breath, and with them intertwine,
Beneath your grasp, their wooden spirits wake,
More blessed than the kiss from my own lips.
Since these inanimate forms find such delight,
Grant them your touch, and me your lips' soft kiss.

"
128,3,"How many times, when you, my serenade, sing
Your ballad on that enchanted wooden lyre,
With tender grace, your nimble fingers cling
And pluck the chords that fan my heart's desire.
I watch those tuning pegs that swiftly sway,
To meet the curve of your enticing hand.
My lips, which yearn to capture your display,
At their own courage, by you are withstood.
To be caressed as those unfeeling pins,
I'd trade my part, and with them interweave,
Beneath your touch, their wooden lives begin,
More blessed than the sigh from my own lips.
Since these inanimate pieces find such grace,
Grant them your fingers, and your lips to me."
129,1,"The cost of passion in a void of disgrace
Is desire set in motion; and, before motion, desire
Is false, lethal, stained with guilt, a merciless case,
Rough, intense, untamed, ruthless, not worth the hire.
Relished but for a moment, then cast aside;
Chased beyond reason, and once obtained,
Rejected as a lure that drove one insane,
A trap maliciously baited to drain.
Mad in the chase and in the holding so;
Obtained, possessed, and still seeking more, extreme;
A pleasure in triumph yet a sorrow extreme;
A hope in prospect, in retrospect, a dream.
  All this the world acknowledges, yet none comprehends
  To avoid the paradise that leads to such a hell.

"
129,2,"The price of fervor in a vacuum of remorse
Is craving unleashed; and, before release, craving
Is treacherous, lethal, drenched in pre-emptive remorse,
Savage, intense, raw, ruthless, never forgiving.
Experienced briefly, then discarded in haste;
Pursued past reason, and once possessed,
Detested as a mirage that left one distraught,
A snare deliberately laid to twist one's thought.
Mad in pursuit and in the holding so;
Seized, held, and still seeking to possess, extreme;
A delight in victory yet a torment extreme;
A wish in prospect, in hindsight, a dream.
  All this the world perceives, yet none discerns
  To elude the haven that leads to such a hell.

"
129,3,"The fee of ardor in a void of disgrace
Is love in action; and, till action, love
Is deceptive, lethal, stained with an early disgrace,
Wild, extreme, raw, relentless, not worth a glove.
Enjoyed but for a fleeting moment, then dismissed;
Crazed past reason, and once attained,
Despised as a phantom that led one amiss,
A snare cunningly laid to bewitch and dismiss.
Mad in pursuit and in the holding so;
Grasped, owned, and still seeking to own, extreme;
A joy in fulfillment yet a sorrow supreme;
A dream in prospect, in retrospect, a dream.
  All this the world understands, yet none understands
  To shun the paradise that leads to such a hell."
130,1,"My beloved's eyes don't mirror the sun's glow,
Crimson lips surpass the hue of coral's red;
If whiteness defines snow, her skin is not so,
Her locks are not wire, but night's soft thread.
I've witnessed roses, red and white in bloom,
But none compare to her unpainted cheeks;
In scented blossoms, joy may find a room,
Her breath, though sweet, such subtle charm it speaks.
Her voice, a melody, I cherish to hear,
Yet acknowledge instrumental notes are pure;
She walks on earth, no goddess in sphere,
Yet, by the stars, I deem her love secure.
  In truth, I find, her love is as unique,
  As those adored through false comparisons weak.

"
130,2,"My sweetheart's eyes hold not the sun's fierce blaze,
Her lips, a deeper red than coral's own;
If winter's snow sets white's standard pace,
Her skin's rich hue supplants that tone.
Her tresses black, no wire could ever match,
Adorning her head like night's velvet veil;
In gardens, roses bloom, a colorful batch,
Yet none resemble the beauty of her wan pale.
Her whispers, sweet as any songbird's tune,
But harmonies, I know, can soothe the soul;
She walks beneath the selfsame moon,
Her love, though grounded, captures my whole.
  By the universe, I hold her love with awe,
  Rare as the stars, no falsehood can flaw.

"
130,3,"My lady's eyes, the sun's brightness they lack,
Her lips, a deeper red than coral's own;
If frost paints white, her skin's hue is on track,
Her hair, no wire, but silk threads have sown.
Roses may boast red and white, but hers,
A gentle blush, no painter's art could seize;
Her breath, a fragrant breeze amidst, disperses,
A sweeter scent than any perfume's ease.
Her voice, a symphony, I long to hear,
Yet acknowledge instrumental notes are true;
She walks on this terrestrial sphere,
Her love, though human, my heart's pursuit.
  By the cosmos, I treasure her love so rare,
  As genuine as any heart laid bare."
131,1,"As domineering as you are lovely,
Your beauty matches those cruel and proud.
To my smitten heart, your worth is so holy,
The most precious gem in the crowd.
Some claim your face lacks power to inspire love,
I dare not contradict, yet in my soul,
A thousand sighs from depths only I know,
Each whispering your name, your image whole.
I swear by this, a thousand faces bear,
The mark of passion kindled by your own,
In silent reverence, each lover swears,
Your darkness fair, when love's sweet throne is known.
  In actions alone, blackness may appear,
  This slander born of deeds far from clear.

"
131,2,"As tyrannical as beautiful you stand,
Your visage cruel, yet captivating all.
To my enamored heart, you command,
A precious treasure, beyond compare.
They whisper doubts of love your face can rouse,
I'd not refute, but deep within, I find,
A multitude of longing sighs reside,
Each one your image in the mind.
A thousand whispers on the breeze do share,
Your visage praised, your beauty extolled,
In quiet moments, love's sweet prayer,
Your shadow graced, a thousandfold.
  In actions, darkness may seem to dwell,
  This slander born where truth and falsehood fell.

"
131,3,"As ruthless as you are fair to see,
Your visage reigns, a tyrant over hearts.
To my fond heart, you hold captive me,
A treasure, unmatched in creation's arts.
They claim your face, no love can then provoke,
I dare not challenge, but in my breast,
A symphony of sighs does softly play,
Each note a testament to your bequest.
A thousand murmurs on the wind converse,
Your beauty praised, your grace their theme,
In silent moments, love's sweet verse,
Your visage haunts, a thousand dreams.
  In actions, darkness may appear,
  This slander born of deeds far and near."
132,1,"Thy cherished eyes, I admire, they, in pity,
Aware of your heart, wound me with disdain,
Adorned in black, as compassion's ally,
Gaze gently on my sorrow's endless plain.
The dawn's first light, in heaven's broad expanse,
Nor the bright star that heralds twilight's hour,
Can match the solemn beauty of your glance,
Bestowing grace on the evening's bower.
So too, may your heart share my grief's dark plight,
As mourning becomes you, in every part,
Then I shall claim black is the new light,
And ugliness dwells where your beauty starts.
  Thus, I'll maintain sorrow is but fair,
  When matched to thee, none can equal its glare.

"
132,2,"In adoration, I gaze on your eyes, so deep,
Yet filled with pity, they pierce my heart,
As darkened by mourning, they weep,
In sympathy, tearing my world apart.
No dawn can compare to your somber sight,
Nor the radiant star that bids the day adieu,
For your mournful eyes outshine the night,
Adorning the evening in elegiac hue.
Oh, let your heart embrace my despair,
As mourning becomes you, in every feature,
Then I shall declare darkness is rare,
And all that's plain lacks your complexion's stature.
  So I'll attest, black is the color of love,
  When worn by thee, it fits as a glove.

"
132,3,"Your eyes, my delight, now shadowed in woe,
Pitying me, they grieve with subtle disdain,
Adorned in black, they are love's ebon beacon,
Gentle on my sorrow, they rain.
The morning sun, in its heavenly course,
Nor the bright star that ushers in repose,
Can compare to the beauty of your remorse,
Gracing the evening with its eve's glow.
Oh, let your heart mourn for my plight,
As mourning becomes you, in every trait,
Then I shall proclaim darkness is bright,
And all that's lovely, your shadows create.
  So I'll confess, black is the shade of the soul,
  When embraced by you, it makes beauty whole."
133,1,"Alas, that heart which brings my heart such woe,
Inflicting pain on both my friend and me.
Must it not suffice to torment me so,
And force my dearest friend to suffer, see?
It wrenches me from my own core, and binds
Another self, more cruelly, to your will;
Abandoned, I, that self, and you, find
Our hearts entwined in torment, thrice multiplied.
Imprison my heart within your fortress chest,
But grant my friend's heart freedom in its place.
Whoso restrains me, let my heart be their guest,
For none can then oppress me in that space.
Yet still you will, for I, confined in you,
Am forced to be your own, and all I do.

"
133,2,"Accursed the heart that makes my heart lament,
Wounding both my friend and me so deep.
Is it not penalty enough to torment
My soul, and force my dearest friend to weep?
It tears me from myself, your cruel gaze
Enslaves my other self, more harshly still;
Abandoned, I, that self, and you amaze
My heart, ensnared, with torment, thrice it kills.
Encase my heart within your breast's embrace,
But let my friend's heart wander, wild and free.
Whoso restrains me, let my heart find grace,
No longer can you then torment me.
Yet still you will, for I, confined in you,
Am forced to be your own, and all I view.

"
133,3,"Cursed be the heart that makes my heart complain,
Inflicting pain on both my friend and me.
Is it not vengeance enough to torture me,
And bind my dearest friend to share this grief?
It wrests me from myself, your tyrant hold
Enslaves my other self, more ruthlessly;
Forsaken, I, that self, and you, behold
Our hearts entangled, thrice tormented be.
Imprison my heart in your unyielding breast,
But let my friend's heart roam, without a care.
Whoso restrains me, let my heart find rest,
No longer can you then torment with fear.
Yet still you will, for I, confined in you,
Am forced to be your own, and all I do."
134,1,"Thus, I confess he belongs to your reign
And I, in turn, am surrendered to your decree,
I'll relinquish myself, to alleviate your disdain,
In hopes that you'll return my heart's treasure to me.
Yet, you won't release him, nor will he break free,
For you are greedy, and he is too kind;
He's learned to write as collateral, like a guarantee,
Under the burden that binds him, just as confined.
The decree of your beauty you'll impose,
A usurer, you lend all with a hidden hook,
Demanding a friend's payment for my woes;
So I lose him, through my own misguided look.
  I have lost him, and now you both possess,
  He pays the price, yet I remain in distress.

"
134,2,"In revealing that he is yours, I make known,
My fate is sealed by your commanding might,
I forfeit myself, to your throne,
Yearning for the solace of my heart's delight.
But neither will you, nor he, grant us release,
For you are grasping, and he is too kind;
He's learned to write as a pledge, like a lease,
Under the weight that binds him, and keeps him confined.
The law of your beauty you'll enforce,
A usurer, you take all with a concealed claim,
Demanding a friend's payment, for my remorse;
So I lose him, through my own unworthy game.
  I have lost him, and now you both possess,
  He pays the debt, yet I'm still in this mess.

"
134,3,"Now, I've admitted, he belongs to your reign,
And I, in submission, yield to your decree,
I'll abandon myself, to your domain,
In hopes that you'll restore my heart's decree.
But you won't, nor will he, break free,
For you are covetous, and he is too kind;
He's learned to write as a bond, like a plea,
Under the debt that binds him, and lags behind.
The judgment of your beauty you'll impose,
A usurer, you lend all with a concealed sting,
Demanding a friend's payment, for my woes;
So I lose him, through my own reckless fling.
  I have lost him, and now you both possess,
  He pays the cost, yet I'm still in distress."
135,1,"The one who possesses their heart's desire, you have your fill,
An overflowing abundance, more than enough to spill.
I, burdened with longing, bring but strife and ill,
Adding to your contentment, swelling your surplus still.

Your heart is boundless, vast and wide,
Will you not grant me a corner to hide?
In others' hearts, my will seems unsightly,
But in yours, it may find its rightful place, brightly.

The sea, vast as it is, welcomes rain,
Growing its expanse, without end or gain.
Rich in desire, enlarge your own,
Make room for one more wish to call your own.

Let no cruel words, no sweet entreaties kill,
Consider all, and in your heart, include my single will.

"
135,2,"Whosoever holds their heart's delight, you have your fill,
An overabundance, and yet still more to instill.
I, consumed by yearning, bring naught but ill,
Yet to your heart's content, I add, thus fulfill.

Your heart is boundless, roomy, and free,
Will you not let my longing dwell in thee?
In others' hearts, my will seems unworthy,
But in yours, it may find a home, fittingly.

The sea, wide as it is, embraces tide,
Expanding its depths, with each ebb and tide.
Rich in desire, increase your own,
Make space for one more wish to call your own.

Let no harsh words, no gentle pleas be stilled,
Consider all, and in your heart, my will fulfill.

"
135,3,"Whoever grasps their heart's yearning, you have your fill,
An overpowering abundance, and still, more to distill.
I, consumed by desire, bring but strife and ill,
Yet to your heart's content, I add, thus fulfill.

Your heart is boundless, wide, and deep,
Will you not grant me a place to sleep?
In others' hearts, my will seems unkind,
But in yours, it may find a refuge, kindly.

The sea, vast as it is, welcomes the wave,
Increasing its might, as it ebbs and raves.
Rich in longing, enlarge your own,
Make room for one more wish to call your own.

Let no unfriendly words, no sweet requests be killed,
Consider all, and in your heart, my will enfold."
136,1,"If your spirit doubts my closeness, dear,
Juror to your sightless soul, I was your heart's desire,
And heart's wish, your soul knows, is welcomed there.
So far for love my love's appeal, kind, fulfill.
Desire will fulfill the treasure of your love,
Indeed, fill it brimful with desires, and mine, one.
In matters of vast capacity, we prove
Among many, one is inconsequential, son.
Then in the multitude, let me be unspoken,
Although in your heart's tally, I am one.
For nothing binds me, if it pleases thee bind
That nothing me, a something, precious, to thee.
  Just make my name your love, and love that constant,
  And then you love me, for my name is Desire, aka Want.

"
136,2,"If your essence fears my nearness, swear,
To your unseeing soul, I am your true longing,
And longing, your soul knows, is welcomed there.
So far for love, my love's plea, gentle, bear.
Yearning will fulfill the treasure of your affection,
Indeed, fill it abundant with yearnings, and mine, one.
In matters of vast capacity, we find
Among many, one is insignificant, dear.
Then in the multitude, let me be unwritten,
Although in your heart's record, I am one.
For nothing holds me, if it pleases you, hold
That nothing me, a something, dear, to thee.
  Just make my name your love, and love that enduring,
  And then you love me, for my name is Craving, aka Yen.

"
136,3,"If your inner being questions my approach,
Judge for your unseeing soul, I was your heart's yearn,
And yearn, your soul knows, is welcomed there.
So far for love, my love's vow, pure, endorse.
Passion will fulfill the treasure of your love,
Indeed, fill it teeming with passions, and mine, one.
In matters of vast capacity, we see
Among many, one is inconsequential, honey.
Then in the multitude, let me be unvoiced,
Although in your heart's log, I am one.
For nothing binds me, if it pleases you, bind
That nothing me, a something, honey, to thee.
  Just make my name your love, and love that unwavering,
  And then you love me, for my name is Passion, aka Ardor."
137,1,"Oh blinded Seer, Love, what hold has thou
Upon my sight, that it may not perceive
The truth it knows, the beauty it should bow
To, yet mistakes for ugliness and grief?
My eyes, ensnared by twisted, biased views,
Are moored within a harbor of the mind;
Yet, Love, you've shaped deceitful manacles,
That bind my heart to follow where they're blind.
Why should my heart believe in scattered dreams,
When it knows well the world's shared, single space?
Or should my eyes, which see, declare the opposite,
To grace falsehood with a lovely face?
In truth and right, my heart and eyes have strayed,
And now to falsehood's contagion they've succumbed.

"
137,2,"Thou false, blind Guide, Love, what grip dost thou have
On my vision, which discerns yet fails?
It knows the map, the path to beauty's cove,
Yet marks the finest treasure as mere trails.
My eyes, entangled by a lover's gaze,
Are tethered in a harbor, where all hearts sway;
Yet, Love, you've fashioned chains of false maze,
That lead my heart to wander, lost, away.
Why should my heart trust in a fractured tale,
When it knows well the sameness of our plight?
Or should my eyes, which witness, tell a different story,
To elevate the lie with purest light?
In truth and right, my heart and eyes have swerved,
And now to deception's allure they've turned.

"
137,3,"Thou sly Deceiver, Love, what hold dost thou
On my perception, which sees yet strays?
It knows the melody, the harmony, true,
Yet hears the sweetest notes as discordant plays.
My eyes, bewitched by passion's heated glare,
Are anchored in a cove where hearts take flight;
Yet, Love, you've wrought a twisted mirror's snare,
That warps my heart within its twisted sight.
Why should my heart believe in twisted lines,
When it knows well the unity of our song?
Or should my eyes, which gaze, insist on division,
To crown the lie with beauty all along?
In truth and right, my heart and eyes have wandered,
And now to illusion's snare they've tethered."
138,1,"When my beloved whispers her truthfulness,
I accept her words, despite their deceit,
To keep her image of me as youthful,
Unaware of the world's cunning stratagems.
Though she knows my prime has come and gone,
She plays the game of feigned innocence,
And I, in turn, believe her false tongue,
In this dance, truth on both sides is absent.
But why does she not confess her wrongs?
And why do I not admit my age?
For love thrives on feigned trust and belief,
And the aged in love dislike revealed years.
So we deceive one another in our flaws,
And with sweet lies, we comfort our disgrace.

"
138,2,"In whispers, my sweet one pledges honesty,
Yet I perceive her falsehoods, yet I believe,
To maintain the notion of my tender age,
Unschooled in life's duplicitous ways.
Thus, she thinks me naive, unknowing still,
Though she knows well my days are past their prime,
I indulge her pretense, her untrue words,
And in this pact, truth on both sides fades.
But why does she not speak of her injustice?
And why do I not confess my age?
For love's sweetest habit is to feign trust,
And age in love abhors the telling of years.
Thus, in our errors, we find solace in lies,
And so, we soothe ourselves with false caresses.

"
138,3,"When my dear one vows her truthful heart,
I choose to trust her, knowing well her lies,
To keep alive the notion of my youth,
Unsuspecting of life's deceitful arts.
Thus, she believes me gullible, unwise,
Though she knows full well my days are fleeting,
I play along, her falsehoods I endure,
And in this act, truth on both sides hides.
But why does she not admit her wrong?
And why do I not confess my age?
For love's most endearing trait is pretense,
And age in love dislikes the telling of years.
So, in our faults, we find comfort in lies,
And in our deceptions, we find sweet solace."
139,1,"Oh, refrain from asking me to explain
The hurt your thoughtlessness inflicts on me;
With words, not gazes, cause this heart to wane,
Exert your strength, and do not harm discreetly.
Admit you love another, yet in my view,
Spare me the sight of wandering eyes;
Why use deceit when your power
Overmatches any shield I can devise?
Grant me the reprieve: my love understands
Her charm has oft been my adversary;
To shield me from such foes, she withstands
Their blows, diverting enmity.
Still, cease this torment; as life ebbs away,
Grant me swift release from this dismay.

"
139,2,"Spare me the task of making right
The injury birthed by your unkindness;
Strike with your words, not lingering sight,
Wield strength against strength, and grant me fairness.
Speak truly: you love another; yet in my gaze,
Spare me the dance of eyes askance.
Why employ tricks when your might
Surpasses my defenses by sheer expanse?
Let me absolve you: my dear heart knows
Her allure has been my foe;
Turning foes from my sight she bestows,
That they elsewhere may strike their blows.
Yet, persist not; near death I stand,
Release me wholly, end this demand.

"
139,3,"Desist from calling me to mend
The wound your unfaithfulness impresses;
Strike with your speech, not your glance, let amends extend,
Wage war with war, and leave no room for guesses.
Confess your heart lies with another; yet in my sight,
Spare me the deceit of roving eyes.
Why employ cunning when your might
Exceeds my defenses, to my surprise?
Grant me the pardon: my love well knows
Her beauty has been my undoing;
To save me from such foes, she bestows
Her strength, and I am only winning.
Yet, relent not; near expiry I lie,
End my torment, and grant my sigh."
140,1,"exhibit wisdom in your harshness; don't tax
My restrained endurance with excessive scorn,
Lest sorrow arm my silence with eloquence,
And words disclose the tenor of my hidden ache.
If I could school you in the art of banter, better still,
Though not to cherish, still, to admit, to let me know,
As ailing men, when death's shadow nears,
Receive only glad tidings from their healers' reports.
For if I should succumb to despair, I'd lose my mind,
And in my madness, I might speak ill of you.
Now, in this topsy-turvy world, where truth is twisted,
Mad detractors find believers in mad listeners.
  To prevent this, and to keep your honor bright,
  Keep your gaze steady, though your heart may stray.

"
140,2,"Be shrewd, yet ruthless; do not overburden
My muzzled tolerance with heavy disdain,
Lest sorrow embolden my muted speech,
And words narrate the texture of my hidden woe.
If I could instill sagacity, better yet,
Though not to love, yet, love, to confess,
As dying men, when the end draws near,
Receive only glad tidings from their caretakers' speech.
For if I should plunge into despair, I'd lose my reason,
And in my madness, I might speak ill of thee.
Now, in this mixed-up world, where falsehoods thrive,
Mad accusers find believers in mad receivers.
  To avoid this, and to uphold your dignity,
  Keep your gaze true, though your heart may roam.

"
140,3,"Exhibit cunning in your ruthlessness; don't provoke
My guarded patience with excessive scorn,
Lest sorrow empower my suppressed voice,
And words convey the depth of my concealed distress.
If I could impart wisdom, better thus,
Though not to love, yet, love, to reveal,
As dying men, when their end is near,
Receive only good news from their physicians' lips.
For if I should fall into despair, I'd lose my mind,
And in my madness, I might speak ill of you.
Now, in this chaotic world, where truth is warped,
Mad defamers find believers in mad spectators.
  To prevent this, and to preserve your good name,
  Keep your eyes fixed, though your heart may wander."
141,1,"In loyalty, I do not cherish thee through sight,
For my eyes in you perceive a multitude of flaws;
But 'tis my soul that cherishes what they find unright,
Defying the judgment of displeased sight it draws.
Neither are my ears enchanted by your voice's song,
Nor are gentle emotions inclined to the lowly touch;
Nor does taste or scent, crave to be part of where they belong,
In any sensual banquet with you as the crutch.
Yet my five senses and my five faculties cannot,
Dissuade one foolish heart from being enslaved by thee,
Remaining steadfast, the semblance of a man is caught,
Thy haughty heart's thrall, a wretched servant to be.
  Only my affliction, thus far, I deem my prize,
  For she who incites my sin grants me anguish and sighs.

"
141,2,"By devotion, I do not admire you through my gaze,
For my eyes in you discover countless imperfections;
Yet my spirit cherishes what they disdain in a haze,
Defying the vision of disapproval and apprehensions.
My ears find no delight in your words' rhythmic dance,
Nor do tender sympathies lean towards unworthy touches;
Nor does taste or scent, seek to join the sensual trance,
In any carnal feast with you in the midst and clusters.
My five senses and my mental prowess cannot,
Expel one captivated heart from your thrall, unyielding,
A man's likeness, trapped, under your dominion,
Thy heart's humble servant, a wretch, forever kneeling.
  Only my suffering, thus far, I acknowledge as grace,
  For she who fuels my vice bestows a heavy, grievous embrace.

"
141,3,"In commitment, I do not behold you through my sight,
For my eyes in you perceive a myriad of faults and blunders;
But my soul cherishes what they spurn, held in delight,
Defying the disapproval of my eyes, it offers no surrenders.
My ears find no allure in your voice's symphony,
Nor do gentle emotions yearn for the lowly touch;
Nor taste or scent, seek to indulge in the sensual spree,
In any lustful feast with you in the spot and clutch.
My five senses and my wisdom cannot,
Dissuade one infatuated heart from serving you devotedly,
Unmoved, the semblance of a man, fate has been cast,
Thy heart's loyal subject, a wretch, ever bound to thee.
  Only my sorrow, thus far, I recognize as virtue,
  For she who incites my sin grants me a heavy heart to nurture."
142,1,"Love's my transgression, virtue's pure abhorrence,
Abhorrence rooted in love's transgressive nature.
Pause and weigh thy own circumstance, grant audience,
Find fault not in love, nor its ardent creator.
Or should there be blame, let not those lips part,
Adorned with hues of deceit, utter reproof.
For they too have stained love's sacred art,
Sealed false vows, as frequently, as I.
Grant me the right to love with equal zest,
As thine eyes wander, and my heart does plead.
Nurture compassion in that breast, so blessed,
That compassion may merit sympathy indeed.
Seek you to keep what you refuse to show?
By self-example, thus, you'll reap the blow.

"
142,2,"My affection's a vice, thy virtue's scorn,
Scorn born of vice, in vice's passions drowned.
Oh, but view thy own condition, worn,
By passions akin, in love's deceit found.
Or if it err, not from those lips that preach,
Stained scarlet with deceit, and false vows sworn.
Rejecting not, the love they too beseech,
Whilst robbing hearts, as thine own, left forlorn.
May I love thee, as thou dost them adore,
Whose hearts are swayed by eyes, as mine by thee.
Cultivate mercy, in thy heart's core,
That mercy may merit pity, plain to see.
Seek'st thou to claim what thou dost withhold?
By thine own actions, thou shalt be repaid in kind, be told.

"
142,3,"Love's my fallacy, thy virtue's disdain,
Disdain from love's fallacious, passionate fire.
Pause and ponder, weigh love's equal pain,
And find no reason to incite desire.
Or if there is, not from those lips that lie,
Adorned in red, they've sealed false bonds ere now.
Robbing hearts, as mine, of love's sweet sigh,
Leaving hearts to ponder love's bitter vow.
Let me love thee, as thou dost them inspire,
Whose hearts are bound, as mine, by love's sweet yoke.
Grant me the grace, to kindle love's desire,
That love may thrive, and hearts in harmony stroke.
Seek you to own what you deny to me?
By self-example, thus, you'll be denied, to see."
143,1,"A mother, busy as a bee, drops all
To chase an escaped bird, her baby left
Crying in vain, ignored, no time at all
For the child's needs, her focus swiftly drifted
To the chase, the capture, leaving behind
Her own flesh, her own blood, in discontent
A mirror image, you run after wind,
Leaving me, your child, to languish, unbent
With worry, love, and fear. But if you find
Your hope, your heart's desire, do turn around,
Embrace me, soothe me, be the mother I need,
And I shall pray for your success, unbound.
  Return to me, and I'll be still, I vow,
  If you but turn, and grant me love, allow.

"
143,2,"Like a mother goose, frantic in her quest
To catch the gosling that has wandered far,
Neglecting those that she should love the best,
Her goslings left, their cries a distant bar;
So you, in pursuit of dreams, abandon me,
Your child, who calls out, yearning for your touch,
Forgetting all the love that once could be,
The warmth, the joy, the laughter, none as such.
But if you find your heart's elusive quest,
Remember me, and come back home, my dear,
With open arms, a love you can't suppress,
And I shall stand, no longer filled with fear.
  I'll wait for you, and when you turn around,
  I'll be the gosling that you'll find, earthbound.

"
143,3,"A mother hen, her chicks in disarray,
Abandons them to chase a fleeing bird,
Her mother's heart now led astray,
While her young ones cry out, unheard;
A parallel, you chase your dreams away,
Forgetting me, your child, who yearns for you,
Lost in thoughts of what you cannot say,
Your heart, your mind, both focused on the new.
But if you grasp your dreams, your heart's delight,
Recall the love, the warmth, the tender care,
And turn around, to make things right,
I'll be the chick who waits, who'll meet you there.
  I'll stand, awaiting your return, and then
  I'll be the chick who'll follow you, again."
144,1,"Two souls I bear, of solace and of sorrow,
That tug within me, like two tides they ebb and flow.
The nobler spirit clad in light and valor,
The darker phantom cloaked in melancholy's woe.
My sinister muse does lure my virtuous guard,
And seeks to taint his essence, pure and bright.
She whispers softly, sowing discord,
Enticing him with her twisted, warped delight.
I ponder if my virtuous one may fall,
Seduced by shadows, losing light's embrace.
Divided, both from me, they stand enthralled,
In each other's darkness, they embrace this race.
Alas, I may not know, but live in plight,
Until my darkened soul expels the light.

"
144,2,"Two hearts I harbor, one of hope, one of hurt,
In ceaseless struggle, locked in tight embrace.
The truer heart adorned in resplendent virtue,
The false one veiled in the shroud of disgrace.
My treacherous love does beckon my sincere guide,
Aiming to poison his spirit, true and kind.
She weaves her siren song, inciting pride,
In hopes of tarnishing his unyielding mind.
I question if my loyal heart may falter,
Swept into the shadows, forsaking the sun.
Divided, both from me, they bitterly alter,
In each other's shadows, their battle is spun.
I bear this secret, a heavy load,
Until my false heart's deceit takes its abode.

"
144,3,"Two souls entwined, in harmony and strife,
Like warring winds, they stir within my breast.
The purer soul, a beacon shining bright,
The darker soul, a storm, forever unrest.
My shadowed soul does call to my guiding star,
Seeking to ensnare him in her twisted dance.
She offers her allure, a tempting bar,
To sway him from his course, and join her trance.
I wonder if my radiant soul may wane,
Swept into the darkness, forsaking the day.
Divided, both from me, they bear this pain,
In each other's grasp, their fates held at bay.
I bear this torment, a ceaseless fight,
Until my darkened soul consumes the light."
145,1,"The lips crafted by Love's own design
Released the words, ""I spurn,"" in pain.
To me, who languished in love's chain,
Her rejection brought anguish and rain.
Her heart, moved by pity, then did show
A tender touch, a softer blow,
And taught her tongue, with new glow,
A warmer, kinder utterance to bestow:
""I spurn"" transformed by gentle art,
Now echoed as day's gentle rebirth,
Chasing shadows from the heart,
Banishing the chill of night's dearth.
  ""I spurn"" from heart she set apart,
  And saved my soul with words, ""not part.""

"
145,2,"The lips that Love designed and made,
In scorn, whispered, ""I no longer wish to stay.""
To me, who languished in love's forlorn shade,
Her cold departure felt like a winter's fray.
Her heart, touched by remorse, then did reveal
A softer sentiment, a warmer zeal,
And taught her tongue, with a healing seal,
A kinder phrase, a tender appeal:
""I no longer wish"" turned into light,
Like dawn's first blush on the horizon's face,
Bringing hope, banishing the night,
Replacing despair with love's embrace.
  ""I no longer wish"" she set aside,
  And saved my heart, with love, she tied.

"
145,3,"The lips that Love's own touch had graced,
In anger, breathed, ""I turn away.""
To me, who languished in love's chased grace,
Her rejection stung like a distant bay.
Her heart, touched by compassion's fire,
Taught her tongue to sing a sweeter choir,
And ""I turn away"" turned to desire,
Like a river flowing to the ocean's pyre.
""I turn away"" from sorrow she freed,
Replacing darkness with day's delight,
Bathing in love's soothing cream,
A gentle balm to soothe the plight.
  ""I turn away"" she softly said,
  And saved my soul, with love, she bade."
146,1,"Oh troubled spirit, heart of my transgression,
Why do you languish, bearing this unrest,
Adorning your exterior with such finesse,
While your inner core doth suffer in suppression?

Why invest so much in this temporal dwelling,
A structure bound to crumble, fade, and fall?
To what end do you give your all,
For worms to come and claim their bequest as well?

Instead, nourish yourself on the servant's despair,
Let them wither while you amass treasures fair.
Exchange fleeting hours for eternal grace,
Find solace within, while wanting without.

Embrace the feast of Death, who consumes all men,
And when Death perishes, no more shall we die then.

"
146,2,"Alas, wretched soul, the core of my corruption,
Bound by the chains of these defiant forces,
Why do you waste away in desolation,
Decorating your outer walls so gaudily?

Why lavish such wealth on this ephemeral dwelling,
A structure destined to decay and crumble?
Shall the heirs of this excess come and assemble,
To consume your legacy, your very substance?

Then, soul, find sustenance in the servant's sorrow,
Let them wither, while you thrive and grow stronger.
Redeem the moments of dross for heavenly boons,
Find nourishment within, while wanting without.

So shall you dine on Death, who consumes all life,
And when Death is slain, no more shall there be strife.

"
146,3,"O weary spirit, heart of my iniquity,
Imprisoned by the tyranny of my sins,
Why do you languish, cloaked in misery,
While your outer shell shines with such brilliance?

Why bestow such riches on this fading edifice,
A monument destined to turn to dust?
Shall the inheritors of this vice,
Consume your legacy, your very essence?

Then, soul, feed on the anguish of your servant,
Let them fade, while you flourish and transcend.
Exchange the transient hours for eternal bliss,
Find solace within, while lacking without.

Thus shall you feast on Death, who devours all souls,
And when Death is vanquished, no more shall we know death's toll."
147,1,"My affection rages, craving its bane,
A sickness nursed by that which feeds its flame.
In vain, the healer of my heart's complaint
Deserts me, and I'm left to my chaotic state.
My love, once tethered by reason's decree,
Now roams, untamed, a wild and frenzied sea.
I've pledged my heart to one of darkest night,
Who's beauty, in truth, is but a mask of deceit.

"
147,2,"My heart's desire, a plague that will not cease,
Burns with a passion for its own increase.
The cure, my reason, in its wisdom, sees
The danger of this malady's sweet deceit.
Yet, I, enthralled, defy its counsel true,
Embracing the sickness that my soul doth strew.
For I have sworn thee fair, and bound my fate,
To one whose heart is as black as pitch-dark slate.

"
147,3,"My love, a sickness, rages in my breast,
Craving the very thing that brings me unrest.
My reason, once its healer, now retreats,
Abandoning me to my unbalanced heart's deceits.
The cure, once sought, now leaves me alone,
Lost in the darkness of this fevered zone.
For I have sworn thee fair, and bound my soul,
To one whose essence is as dark as coal."
148,1,"Oh, what gaze has love instilled in my regard,
Devoid of true vision's faithful accord?
Or if my sight yet holds some honest regard,
Where is my sense, which errs in judgment flawed?
If deemed fair be the focus of love's false sight,
What worth the world, that deems it otherwise?
If not so fair, then love's deceit is right,
Its truth obscured by all men's denials.
How can love's gaze be true, when clouded eyes
Shed tears and watch in ceaseless yearning blind?
No wonder then, my view I often miss,
The sun itself waits for heaven's light to shine.
  Love's cunning craft, with tears, doth blind my mind,
  Lest clear-sighted eyes should find its faults, unkind.

"
148,2,"What sight has love bestowed upon my gaze,
That strays from truth and mires in false display?
Or if my vision keeps its honest ways,
Why does my sense such falsehoods now convey?
If deem'd fair what love's deluded eyes adore,
What worth the world, that deems it otherwise?
If not so fair, then love's deceit is more,
Its truth obscured by all men's nays and cries.
How can love's sight be true, when dimmed by tears,
Watching and weeping through the endless night?
No wonder then, my view is often veiled,
The sun itself waits for dawn's resplendent light.
  Love's subtle ploy, with tears, my sight beguiled,
  Lest keen-eyed view should find its faults, reviled.

"
148,3,"What gaze has love imposed upon my sight,
That wanders far from truth and clear discern?
Or if my vision keeps its honest light,
Why does my sense such falsehoods now discern?
If deem'd fair what love's deluded eyes perceive,
What worth the world, that deems it otherwise?
If not so fair, then love's deceit's reprieve,
Its truth obscured by all men's reproachful cries.
How can love's sight be true, when dimmed by tears,
Watching and weeping through the endless flight?
No wonder then, my view is often marred,
The sun itself waits for day's enlighten'd might.
  Love's cunning scheme, with tears, my sight is barred,
  Lest piercing eyes should find its faults, uncharmed."
149,1,"Dare you, O heartless, claim I feel not love
For thee, when in our shared pains I'm drowned?
Do I not ponder thee when I forget
My own identity, by thee bound?
Who hates thee that I name as my ally?
On whom dost thou frown that I do adore?
Indeed, if thou dost scowl on me, I try
To wreak revenge with tears that flow no more.
What virtue do I see in me, so great,
That I should scorn to serve thee as is due?
When all my virtues bow to thy defect,
Enslaved by the power of thy gaze anew.
  Yet, love, persist in hatred, for I see
  The truth: you love those whom I cannot.

"
149,2,"Can you, O unkind, claim I am without love
For you, when in our strife I find my peace?
Do I not think of you when I remove
My thoughts from self, to serve but you release?
Who turns from you that I should call a friend?
On whom do you frown that I do pursue?
If you are harsh, do I not seek to mend
The wounds with sorrow fresh, as if it's new?
What worth do I in myself discern
That I should slight your service, proud and vain?
When all my virtues bend to your concern,
Ensnared by the allure of your disdain.
  Still, love, increase your scorn, for now I know
  You cherish those your gaze doth deign to show.

"
149,3,"O harsh one, can you claim I am devoid
Of love for you, when in our conflict lies
My solace? In myself, when self is destroyed,
Do I not contemplate your mysteries?
Who turns from you that I should call my kin?
On whom do you scowl that I do follow?
Indeed, if you are cruel, then I begin
To wreak revenge on self, with present woe.
What merit do I see in me, so fine,
That I should spurn your service, haughty heart?
When all my virtues bend to your design,
Ensnared by the charm of your cold retort.
  Yet, love, maintain your disdain, for now I grasp
  The truth: you love those whom your gaze enwraps."
150,1,"Oh, by what force dost thou wield such sway,
My heart's content to bend and sway?
To cloud my judgment, lead me astray,
And paint deceit where truth should lay?

Whence cometh this corruption of the good,
That in thy vices I find charm,
In thy transgressions, I see beauty stood,
And in thy chaos, a soothing balm?

Who hath shown thee how to twist my heart,
To cherish more the more I see amiss?
Though I should push thee far, depart,
My heart still clings, with love grown' miss.

If thy unworthiness hath wrought this love,
More worthy am I to be loved above.

"
150,2,"How dost thou, wretch, with such command,
Rule my heart, with cruel hand?
To blind me, make truth seem false,
And evil's face, fair as any elf?

From whence dost thou derive this art,
To twist my soul, and tear it apart?
To find delight in what I despise,
And in thy darkness, see the skies?

Who hath taught thee to ensnare my heart,
To love thee more, as thou dost thine own part?
Though I should flee, turn from thee,
My heart still yearns, with love's decree.

If thy unworthiness hath raised this flame,
More worthy I to share thy name.

"
150,3,"By what enchantment dost thou bind,
My heart, and make it blind?
To see the false as true, the wrong as right,
And find in darkness, the softest light?

Whence dost thou derive this wicked might,
To make my soul take flight,
And in thy vile deeds, find grace,
And in thy darkest corners, embrace?

Who hath taught thee to ensnare my heart,
To love thee more, as thou dost thine own part?
Though I should shun, and turn away,
My heart still calls, in love's array.

If thy unworthiness hath wrought this plight,
More worthy I to share thy night."
151,1,"In its youth, love has yet to learn of duty;
Yet who among us is unaware
That duty springs from love's own fruitful beauty?
So, cunning charmer, do not call me out on error,
Lest you become entangled in my wrongs.
For, as you deceive me, I abandon
My nobler nature to my body's treachery.
My spirit informs my flesh that it may claim
Victory in love; the flesh, no longer tame,
Rises at your mention and proclaims
You as its prize, its conquest and its aim.
And thus, in pride, it serves you, ever near,
To stand by you, to fall with you, my dear.

"
151,2,"Love is too young to grasp the weight of right,
Yet who among us is ignorant
Of duty's birth in love's embrace so tight?
Thus, sly beguiler, do not chide my sin,
Lest you become entwined in my transgressions.
For, as you lead me astray, I forsake
My nobler self to my body's treachery.
My soul whispers to my flesh that it may soar
In love; the flesh, no longer a bore,
Rises at your name, its power to explore,
A triumphant trophy, yours to adore.
And thus, in pride, it serves, always near,
To rise and fall, for your love, my dear.

"
151,3,"Love is too young to comprehend what duty means;
Yet who is unaware that duty blooms
From love's own garden, watered by its springs?
So, subtle trickster, do not reproach my sins,
Lest you become entangled in my errors.
For, as you deceive me, I betray
My nobler self to my body's treachery.
My soul informs my flesh that it may strive
For victory in love; the flesh, now alive,
Rises at your name, its purpose to derive
From your affection, its reason to thrive.
And thus, in pride, it serves, ever so near,
To stand by you, to fall by your side, my dear."
152,1,"In loving you, I've broken sacred vows,
Yet you have sworn to me love twice over;
In deed, your marital bed you disavow,
And pledge new enmity, after love's labor.
But why should I reproach you for two breaches,
When I am guilty of transgressions manifold?
My vows, but tools to bring you to my reaches,
My faith, a shadow, fleeting and cold.
For I have sworn by your profound kindness,
By your affection, loyalty, and trust;
Yet blinded by desire, I twist and bend,
Truth's enemy, in deceit I am immersed.
  For I have painted you as fair, blinded eye,
  To lie against the truth, so vile and unworthy.

"
152,2,"By thee, I am ensnared, my love forsworn,
Yet twice art thou entangled in love's snare;
In action, thou didst rend thy marital scorn,
And plighted new disdain, after passion's glare.
But why should I reproach thy double falsehood,
When I am stained with countless perjuries?
My vows, mere shadows, swiftly withered, hold
No weight compared to your deep-rooted ties.
For I have sworn by thine unwavering constancy,
By thy love, thy truth, thy faithfulness so rare;
Yet, in my madness, I have twisted reality,
And bound thee in the chains of my despair.
  For I have sworn thee true, false heart, unwise,
  To lie against the truth, before thine eyes.

"
152,3,"Ensnared by love, I've broken sacred vows,
Yet thou hast sworn to me, love's bond unbroken;
In act, your marital vows you disavow,
And pledge new scorn, after love awoken.
But why should I reproach your double falsehood,
When I am stained with transgressions deep?
My vows, mere whispers, swiftly lost, hold
No truth compared to your promises so steep.
For I have sworn by your profound devotion,
By your love, thy truth, thy faithfulness so rare;
Yet, in my blindness, I have twisted reality,
And bound thee in the chains of my despair.
  For I have sworn thee fair, false heart, in lies,
  To swear against the truth, before thine eyes."
153,1,"Cupid laid aside his flaming torch to rest,
A follower of Diana chanced upon the sight,
And plunged the symbol of his love and unrest
In a mountain stream, where it extinguished in the night.
The waters kept the fire's essence, though, alive,
A bubbling, healing source for all ailments dear,
Yet, at my beloved's gaze, Love's flame revives,
Her eyes, a furnace, where the ember reappears.
To seek relief, I ventured to the bath,
A wretched soul, longing for a touch of peace,
Alas! The cure I sought was not there, in aftermath,
For Love's true remedy lies where it had its release—
In the wellspring of my lady's gaze, the fire's birth,
A potion that both wounds and mends the heart at once, in equal worth.

"
153,2,"In slumber, Cupid lost his grip on Love's fierce brand,
A nymph of Artemis saw her chance, and snatched it from his hand,
She quenched the flame within a crystal mountain's land,
A sacred pool absorbed the fire, forever to expand.
A cure for lovers' pains, the waters held the fire's might,
Yet, when my sweetheart's eyes met mine, Love's torch burned bright.
To seek a cure, I entered the healing waters, that very night,
But found no solace, for Love's true balm was out of sight.
The source of Love's renewal lay where it had first been doused,
In my beloved's gaze, the eternal, burning house.
The bath could not compare, its power weak and hushed,
For Love's true remedy was something I'd endured,
In the fiery depths of my beloved's eyes, Love's birth,
A dance of passion, pain, and solace, a paradox of rebirth.

"
153,3,"Cupid, in dreams, abandoned his fiery arrow's trace,
A huntress of Diana found it, cooling in a brook's embrace.
The waters captured Love's essence, a gift from the divine grace,
A healing balm for all who sought a lover's embrace.
But when my beloved gazed upon me, Love's flame rekindled once more,
Her eyes, a forge, where the ember glowed, forever to endure.
To seek a cure, I ventured to the sacred, healing shore,
But found no solace, for Love's true balm was something I'd endure.
The source of Love's renewal lay where it had first been quenched,
In my beloved's gaze, the eternal, burning bench.
The waters could not compare, their power faint and stretched,
For Love's true remedy was something I'd been taught,
In the fiery depths of my beloved's eyes, Love's birth,
A dance of longing, pain, and solace, a paradox of rebirth."
154,1,"In ancient times, the cherub of affection,
Lost in slumber, his fervent torch did lay,
While chaste nymphs, in purity their direction,
Passed by; one maiden, in her hand did stray,
The loveliest of votaries, purest of heart,
She seized the flame, which countless true souls had stoked,
And thus the commander of the carnal art
Was, in dreams, by innocence disarmed, unwoke.
This torch she plunged into a well nearby,
Wherefrom Love's fire drew heat eternal,
Creating a bath, a healing remedy
For hearts unwell; but I, enslaved, did travel
  To this same source, in hope to find a cure,
  Alas, Love's fire warms water; water doth not cure.

"
154,2,"In deep antiquity, the minor deity of passion,
Lay in repose, his inflaming brand nearby,
As passing nymphs, in chaste devotion fashion,
Came dancing by; one maiden, purest of eye,
Lifted the fire, which countless true hearts had fed,
The sovereign of desire, in slumber, she unmanned,
By a virgin's gentle, unsuspecting hand,
His fiery brand, by cool well water drenched,
Expelled the heat, and gained a healing potion,
A cure for hearts by Love's own fire afflicted,
Yet I, the captive of my lady's devotion,
Came to this well, in hope of my own healing,
  Discovering that Love's fire warms the waters,
  But water cannot quench the lover's ardors.

"
154,3,"In elder days, the lesser god of tender feelings,
Sleeping, left his fiery brand at hand,
As passing by, the chaste nymphs, their vows fulfilling,
One maiden fair, with virtuous hand, did take command,
Of the flame, which countless true hearts had made grow,
The monarch of desire, she, in sleep, did quell,
By her innocent touch, the fiery glow,
Of Love's own general, his power fell,
Into a well nearby, she plunged the brand,
Transforming Love's eternal fire to water,
A cure for hearts, by passion's flames burnt, and,
I, bound to my beloved, sought this fountain,
  To find a cure, but learned this lesson true:
  Love's fire heats water, water cannot subdue."
