## Introduction
﻿
This document provides comprehensive instructions on how to set up and run a federated learning project that leverages large language models (LLMs). The project is organized into several directories and scripts, each serving a specific purpose in the federated learning workflow. The instructions herein are intended to ensure that users can seamlessly navigate, configure, and execute the project components in a manner that is both efficient and effective.
﻿
## Prerequisites
﻿
Before running the project, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
﻿
1. **Operating System**: The project is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux or macOS.
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.6 or higher must be installed on your system. You can verify your Python version by running:
```sh
python3 --version
```
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
﻿
## Directory Structure
﻿
The project is organized into the following directories and files:
﻿
- `client/`: Contains client-side code for federated learning.
- `datasets/`: Includes datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `example_test/`: Provides example tests to validate the setup.
- `federated_learning/`: Contains core federated learning algorithms and utilities.
- `lora/`: Implements Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques for LLMs.
- `output/`: Stores output files such as logs and model checkpoints.
- `processing_data/`: Scripts for data preprocessing.
- `scripts/`: Additional scripts for various tasks.
- `config.py`: Configuration file for setting up the environment and parameters.
- `main_evalution.py`: Main script for model evaluation.
- `main_train.py`: Main script for model training.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python packages.
﻿
## Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/federated-llm.git
cd federated-llm
```
﻿
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
﻿
Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
﻿
### Step 3: Configure the Environment
﻿
Edit the `config.py` file to set up the necessary environment variables and parameters. This file includes configurations for data paths, model parameters, and federated learning settings.

﻿
### Step 4: Preprocess the Data
﻿
Run the data preprocessing scripts located in the `processing_data/` directory to prepare the datasets for training and evaluation:
```sh
python processing_data/preprocess.py
```
﻿
### Step 5: Train the Model
﻿
Execute the `main_train.py` script to start the training process. This script will initiate the federated learning workflow and train the LLM across multiple clients:
```sh
python main_train.py
```
﻿
### Step 6: Evaluate the Model
﻿
After training, evaluate the model using the `main_evalution.py` script. This script will assess the model's performance on the test datasets:
```sh
python main_evalution.py
```
﻿
## Detailed Explanation of Key Components
### Federated Learning
﻿
The `federated_learning/` directory contains the core algorithms and utilities for federated learning. This includes client-server communication protocols, aggregation methods, and optimization techniques.
﻿
### Large Language Models (LLMs)
﻿
The `lora/` directory implements Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to fine-tune large language models efficiently. This approach reduces the computational overhead while maintaining model performance.
﻿
### Client-Side Code
﻿
The `client/` directory includes code that runs on individual clients participating in the federated learning process. Each client trains the model on its local data and communicates updates to the central server.
﻿
### Data Processing
﻿
The `processing_data/` directory contains scripts for data preprocessing. These scripts handle tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.
﻿
### Example Tests
﻿
The `example_test/` directory provides example tests to validate the setup and ensure that all components are functioning correctly.
